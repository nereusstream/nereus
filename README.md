# Nereus

Nereus is a Pulsar-native shared-storage streaming engine built around an Oxia
metadata/coordination plane, selectable primary-WAL/object-materialization profiles,
a shared object data plane, broker-locality without durable broker ownership, and a
single logical `streamId + offset` coordinate.

The project website and namespace authority is `nereusstream.com`; Java packages and Maven coordinates use
`com.nereusstream`. This is the standalone product repository for `github.com/nereusstream/nereus`.
Pulsar and KoP changes are developed in organization-owned fork repositories,
not as patch overlays inside this repo.

## Related Organization Repositories

Expected upstream forks:

```text
github.com/nereusstream/pulsar  -> fork of apache/pulsar
github.com/nereusstream/kop     -> fork of streamnative/kop
```

The main Nereus repository holds product-owned modules and authoritative design documents.
Forks hold changes that must land inside upstream Pulsar or KoP trees.

## Current Phase

Future 1 / Phase 1 Core StreamStorage M0-M8 is complete:

- protocol-neutral API/value/error contracts；
- Oxia key/record/codec, fake metadata, and production Oxia Java adapter；
- Object WAL v1 writer/reader, entry index, checksums, and resource guards；
- append, resolve/read, trim/recovery, restart, and post-head repair state machines；
- ordinary and Docker-backed final acceptance gates。

Only `OBJECT_WAL_SYNC_OBJECT` is a Phase 1 execution target. BookKeeper and async
materialization profiles are reserved design/API boundaries, not implemented support.

Future 2 F2-M0 design convergence and the locked Pulsar API spike are complete. The active
implementation milestone is F2-M1 (projection model); `nereus-managed-ledger` still has no production
facade, so Future 2 itself is not implemented.

Start with `docs/design/nereus-design-index.md` for document authority and current status. Use
`docs/phase-1-core-stream-storage/README.md` for the implemented L0 contract and
`docs/phase-2-managed-ledger-facade/README.md` for the active F2 code-level design.
