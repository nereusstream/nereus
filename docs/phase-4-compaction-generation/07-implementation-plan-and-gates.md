# Phase 4 Implementation Plan and Gates

## 1. Current Status

F4-M0 is complete against Nereus `e330969cd5c2c11cd38d0bd7f687185171ae91e2` and current local Pulsar source lock
`c59da789e88df2b57829de3277c60194b44fceb6`. F4-M1、F4-M2 and F4-M3 completed their ordinary and Docker-backed
final gates on 2026-07-15；the following foundation parts are implemented and covered by focused and real-service tests：

- F4 API identities、materialization module boundary、Oxia keyspace/records/codecs/store adapters and conditional
  delete surface；
- replayable private staging、guarded/retried S3 PUT、SDK-response plus exact-byte upload completion、exact
  logical-prefix LIST、HEAD-before-DELETE、narrow HTTP 405/501 conditional-delete fallback and the safe local
  object-store fixture；
- strict physical-object/reference-domain proof values、the protocol-neutral generation activation proof surface and
  the durable create/revalidate/release reader-pin handshake backed by one process/object lease；
- durable protection acquire/revalidate/same-key owner-transfer/owner-authorized-release handshakes, including
  response-loss cleanup ownership and fail-safe deletion-veto behavior；
- deterministic fake physical metadata storage used by the reader/reference handshake tests；
- partition-aware in-memory Oxia backend plus generation、64-shard stream-registration、256-shard physical-root and
  exact conditional-delete store contracts；
- production/fake shared physical-root lifecycle/epoch validation, record contradiction tests and response-loss-safe
  generation-index/task create recovery with immutable identity checks；
- `GenerationMetadataTransitions` guards closed index/task lifecycles、the publication-before-allocation task shape、
  monotonic checkpoint/registration/recovery progress and immutable retention boundaries；
- 49 frozen F4 metadata envelope vectors cover every lifecycle/optional branch、retirement-journal and activation record；focused real Oxia covers slash-aware
  fixed-depth ranges、restart、CAS、pagination and conditional metadata delete；
- M1 contract/document/module/source-lock/guarded-PUT audits and the `phase4M1Check`/`phase4M1FinalCheck` tasks exist。

`phase4M1Check`、`phase4M1FinalCheck --rerun-tasks`、`phase4M2Check`、
`phase4M2FinalCheck --rerun-tasks`、`phase4M3Check` and `phase4M3FinalCheck --rerun-tasks` passed on 2026-07-15. M2 adds authoritative committed-generation resolve/read,
restart-safe publication, pin-owned fallback/quarantine and a real Oxia/LocalStack independent-runtime fixture.
F4-M1、F4-M2 and F4-M3 are complete/final-gated. F4-M3 has nine implementation checkpoints：the real compacted
format/read path, the deterministic policy/planner/task-store/recovery/registered-stream-scan path, and the
exact-source reader plus claim-to-output-ready worker path, followed by task-protection owner crash-cut reconciliation
across recovery/publication, then monotonic advisory checkpoint reconstruction plus bounded dispatcher/service
lifecycle. A sixth checkpoint proves Pulsar Entry/NCP1 exact-byte and middle-batch MessageId round trip while keeping
the generation projection ref out of per-entry metadata. A seventh checkpoint implements the protocol-neutral
topic-compaction decoder/strategy SPI, closed disposition wire ids, immutable compaction-key facts and an exact
frozen-identity registry. An eighth checkpoint implements proof-driven terminal task/protection/stats/old-checkpoint
retirement with exact reload and response-loss convergence. A ninth checkpoint implements COMMITTED-source topic
bootstrap、tagged-v1 keyed/unkeyed encoding、shared-budget checksum-verified sorted spills、bounded two-pass exact
replay and the NTC1 worker/view-isolated publication path. M3's deterministic and real-service gates additionally
prove two-worker claim convergence、restart/output reuse、lost `OUTPUT_READY` response recovery、full output bytes and
all-64-shard pagination without watch/process-local hints. F4-M3 is complete/final-gated. This is not a Phase 4
completion claim. F4-M4 implementation checkpoint A now provides the NRC1 domain/format、spill-backed one-at-a-time
writer、strict bounded open/lookup path、attempt/key identity and authoritative metadata verifier. Its focused object-
store/materialization tests and `phase4M4CheckpointCheck --rerun-tasks` passed on 2026-07-15 (114 tasks) and are the
object-protocol evidence boundary. Checkpoint B now provides exact intent preparation、ACTIVE root and permanent
commit-owned protection before head CAS、exact generation-zero materialization and permanent index-owned protection
before strict success, with the same sequence used by recovery and wired into production shared-Oxia assembly.
Metadata/core/pulsar unit tests and affected real-service source-set compilation pass；a Docker-backed checkpoint-B
execution gate has not yet run. Full recovery-root/
anchor-aware retirement/GC and async/Pulsar execution paths still arrive in the remainder of F4-M4–M6. Checkpoint C's
current foundation adds the exact paged append-recovery tail in production/fake metadata stores, the root-stable
`AnchorAwareCommitWalker`, the bounded whole-commit `RecoveryCheckpointBuilder`, and root-owned pending/permanent
protection handshakes. Metadata contracts and focused walker/builder tests pass；guarded upload、full verification、
root CAS/reconciliation、retirement and GC were not implemented by that foundation. Checkpoint D now adds guarded
if-absent NRC1 upload、exact HEAD/full verification、pending protection、root CAS with exact response-loss reload, and
bounded restart reconciliation of current-root object/target protections from the NRC1 publication table. Focused
tests use the real in-memory Oxia adapter plus fake physical/local object storage to prove lost root-CAS response and
process death after CAS but before permanent protection. Checkpoint E now adds sparse offset-to-entry lookup、the
root-double-read/pinned checkpoint append replay adapter、shared live/NRC1 request validation and the explicit
`AppendCoordinator`/`DefaultStreamStorage` injection seam. Checkpoint F now adds exact committed-index restore、
raw/envelope digest separation、root-stable pinned NRC1 repair、highest healthy target selection、current-root-owned
target protection and the `GenerationReadResolver` terminal repair seam. Runtime composition、retirement and GC
remain. Checkpoint G now adds exact read-before-delete generation-zero source and Phase 1 object-audit metadata
adapters、committed-marker capture、legacy/generic encoding separation and a borrowed get/delete-only shared-Oxia
bridge. Checkpoint H adds strict GC configuration、ACTIVE-root candidates and bounded canonical plans whose complete
domain/protection/metadata-key facts can be recomputed before destructive retirement. Checkpoint I adds canonical exact-domain
aggregation、mandatory metadata-fact reload、recoverable ACTIVE/MARKED/DELETING fencing and full 256-shard metadata
root enumeration. It stops at durable delete intent；no source/protection/audit/object delete path is enabled by
checkpoints G–I. Checkpoint J adds query-bound stateless revalidation、exact reference-to-removal binding and the
affected-stream generation、append-recovery and materialization reference domains. Checkpoint K adds the core shared
bounded snapshot builder、composed managed-ledger generation-marker/exact-stream-authority APIs, and affected-stream
projection-generation plus cursor-snapshot domains. Future-sentinel domains、ownerless global absence proof、
retirement planning and runtime composition remain pending. Checkpoint L's protocol foundation adds
the reference-set-v2 compact domain proof and validated retirement manifest/protection/removal records/codecs. Its
durable-store slice now adds fixed-depth object/attempt keyspace、production/fake create/scan parity and a
manifest-last seal/load service. Mandatory collector injection now seals/authenticates it before MARK and reloads it
at drain admission and the final delete-intent fence. Checkpoint M adds the root-authenticated DELETING recovery、
typed dispatch seam、journaled protection removal、exact object delete and DELETED convergence. Checkpoint N adds
strict generation-index restart routing、exact generation-zero conditional deletion、higher-generation
`DRAINING -> RETIRED` recovery and root+journal reauthentication at every destructive batch/final object fence.
Checkpoint O adds exact-key legacy/generic marker/commit inverse routing、response-loss-safe typed handlers and an
NRC1/source/index/marker-bound generation-zero plan builder plus exact-key revalidator. Checkpoint P adds strict
canonical publication resolution、current exact COMMITTED index binding、another-object ACTIVE physical-root proof and
final exact index/root reload. Checkpoint Q adds a shared replacement verifier、COMMITTED-view whole-source NRC1 tiling
and response-loss-safe higher-generation `COMMITTED/QUARANTINED -> DRAINING`, with DRAINING plan-time reproof.
Checkpoint R adds exact completed-trim eligibility for generation-zero and either higher view、current strictly newer
TOPIC_COMPACTED/ACTIVE same-view replacement proof, and a pre-read source-retirement grace fence；all three higher
eligibility branches are repeated at DRAINING plan time. Checkpoint S adds the durable cluster generation-activation record/codec/exact-key store、
read-only lookup、PREPARED bootstrap、monotonic CAS guard and frozen lifecycle/capability vectors. It is authority
foundation only. Checkpoint T adds the future sentinel、activation/backfill/domain-set-gated 64-shard global scope and
ownerless variants for all five concrete domains. Checkpoint U adds the persisted dual-absence DELETED-root pass、
fresh ownerless-domain/handle revalidation、late exact-byte cleanup、Phase 1 references-before-manifest retirement and
root-last response-loss-safe CAS. Checkpoint V adds guarded cursor-snapshot upload、current-root pending protection、
cursor-CAS-then-permanent completion、response-loss repair on hydrate/read、durable reader lease and the shared
physical/protection/read-pin production wiring for this path. Checkpoint W adds strict NPR1 projection resolution、
the all-64-shard physical-root/cursor-root live-reference backfill、exact commit/index/cursor owner protections、
stable final revalidation and response-loss-safe dual activation proofs. Broker registration backfill proof/barrier、
object inventory、registration retirement and the remaining materialization/GC runtime composition were pending at W.
Checkpoint AJ adds complete bounded cursor-snapshot candidate discovery plus the post-drain final-inventory callback；
checkpoint AK makes its evidence restart-reconstructable, adds exact drift rollback and composes the cursor executor、
six domains、journal and source-retirement lifecycle under the production provider. Checkpoint AL adds the owned
current-writer inventory scanner and exact missing-root registration. Checkpoint AM adds the proof-driven
registration-retirement coordinator and exact managed-ledger
cursor/retention authority. Its ordinary gate now includes non-empty published-workflow and real NRC1 recovery-root
owner/protection drain plus delete-response-loss cuts. Checkpoint AN adds complete 256-shard root routing/recovery、
complete 64-shard registration retirement、inventory-last ordering, fixed-delay/non-overlap/hint coalescing and
close-first runtime ownership. Checkpoint AO maps the complete bounded physical-GC broker configuration into the typed
runtime and removes provider-local protection/lease/orphan timing constants. Safe defaults still start no pass；coverage/
delete activation and the real-service final gate remain pending. Checkpoint AP now implements the independent
configured-scope object-store capability proof：guarded PUT、exact HEAD、complete LIST、ETag-bound exact DELETE、
response-loss absence convergence and idempotent cleanup produce one deterministic non-secret V1 scope digest, but
the probe itself does not persist the digest or enable deletion. Checkpoint AQ adds the bounded product-owned
coordinator that freezes ACTIVE/readiness/domain/registration authority, runs and verifies the two coverage
backfills, runs the configured-scope canary and atomically installs its digest with both V1 delete bits. Provider and
Pulsar composition、restart scope-digest gating and the real-service final gate were still pending at AQ. Checkpoint AR
now installs the coordinator through runtime/factory and the locked Pulsar zero-failure sequence, shares one expected
scope digest with the operation guard, and prevents mutating startup/DELETING recovery unless durable scope and domain
authority are exact. Checkpoint AS creates one exact registered-stream global/projection reference-domain assembly for
both activation revalidation and GC, and proves the first real Oxia/LocalStack activation、wrong-scope、empty-list and
lost-DELETE-response restart slice. Checkpoint AT proves another independent runtime resumes the exact durable
DELETING root after the real object DELETE completes but before the old process invokes its DELETED-root CAS. The
checkpoint AU fixture then proves an applied DELETED-root Oxia CAS with a lost response converges through the exact
replacement reload and never repeats the LocalStack DELETE. Checkpoint AV forces two independent worker runtimes to
race the same MARKED root and proves one durable DELETING intent plus idempotent exact-delete convergence. The
checkpoint AW fixture then recovers 128 MARKED and 128 DELETING roots across all 256 physical shards in a fresh
runtime with every object LIST forced empty. It also aligns inventory progress with the frozen opaque-token contract
instead of inferring cross-page logical order. The remaining real-service two-broker/scale/failure matrix remains
pending.
Checkpoint X starts M5 by adding the exact durable
registration create/refresh/final-revalidation coordinator、topic-open return barrier and shared generation-store
production ownership. Checkpoint Y adds the locked Pulsar fork's reserved generation lookup property、exact
binding/cursor/generation two-stable-snapshot barrier、deterministic broker-incarnation readiness epoch/full digest
and registry-notification invalidation. Checkpoint Z adds the exact unloaded-projection candidate、canonical
one-namespace-at-a-time cold-topic traversal、bounded concurrency/deadline、deterministic full report and final
binding/readiness revalidation. Checkpoint AA adds the product-neutral exact-readiness provider/completion value、
shared activation-store runtime ownership、zero-failure admission、response-loss-safe durable
`streamRegistrationBackfill` CAS、same-epoch coverage immutability and newer-epoch dependent-proof invalidation.
Checkpoint AB adds the product-owned generation activation guard、frozen six-domain digest、strict
projection/L0/registration capture、response-loss-safe monotonic topic marker、proof revalidation、exact
projection-domain delete admission and the disabled-by-default Pulsar first-activation switch.
Checkpoint AC adds the product-owned publication coordinator、proof-gated
`PREPARED -> ACTIVE(publication=true, deletion=false)` CAS、bounded conflict/lost-response recovery、final readiness
revalidation and broker sequencing after a zero-failure durable backfill proof. The task/index/checkpoint/trim/delete
mutation call sites remain pending. Checkpoint AD adds the opt-in Phase 4 Object-WAL profile matrix、protected-head
`WAL_DURABLE` acknowledgement boundary、independently bounded generation-zero repair、root-stable restart scanner and
protected read-after-commit live repair. Checkpoint AE adds exact F2 sync/async profile round-trip、per-stream-lane
pre-IO activation/marker proof and final revalidation、authoritative records/bytes/age lag measurement and
throttle/reject semantics. Checkpoint AF atomically installs the Phase 4 resolver、pre-IO guard、
generation-aware read/failure handler、NRC1 replay/index repair、generation-zero repair-before-plan and owned
materialization service in `DefaultNereusRuntimeProvider`；the local Pulsar fork maps exact sync/async first-create
profile and the complete bounded materialization configuration. Legacy constructors remain Phase 1.5-only, sync is
still the default, and async remains activation-proof gated. Checkpoint AG implements the product-neutral logical
retention correctness slice：checked exact Pulsar policy values、bounded config/evidence values、a stable
source-index-verified candidate planner and an ownership/activation-gated service whose only mutation is the F3
`CursorRetentionCoordinator.requestTrim` protocol. Checkpoint AH adds the shared bounded/coalescing execution lane、
whole-operation timeout/close、production runtime/per-ledger facade composition and five exact Pulsar broker config
fields. Checkpoint AI adds exact immutable effective retention/backlog policy mapping、stable generation readiness、
registration-backed marker admission with post-activation policy reload, and loaded/unloaded/partition-child
`TRIM_TOPIC` routing. Physical GC composition and the aggregate M5/M6 rollout remain pending.

`phase4M4ProtectedAppendCheck` passed on 2026-07-15, including the inherited M1–M3/NRC1 chain、all affected Nereus
checks/source-set compilation and the locked local Pulsar M4 check. This is checkpoint-B evidence, not a claim that
the Docker-backed M4 final scenarios or any delete path are available.

A later milestone is complete only when：

1. every named production artifact exists or a reviewed equivalent is documented；
2. record/object golden bytes and focused deterministic tests pass；
3. fake and production adapters share the same invariant contract；
4. the milestone Gradle gate exists and is green；
5. required real Oxia/LocalStack/Pulsar evidence is green；
6. both Nereus and local Pulsar worktrees are clean at the recorded source locks；
7. authoritative docs are updated from planned to exact implemented behavior in the same commit。

## 2. F4-M0 Design Gate

### 2.1 Evidence completed

- audited current `ReadTarget`、resolver、dispatcher/registry、offset-index and stable append split；
- audited `StreamHeadRecord`/commit chain and proved that source deletion needs a recovery checkpoint；
- audited current ObjectStore and low-level Oxia client absence of list/delete；
- audited F3 owner-session、pending protection/trim、cursor snapshot inventory and no-op trim handoff；
- audited local Pulsar capability、feature resolver/validator、loaded/unloaded admin and backlog eviction paths；
- froze separate `COMMITTED`/`TOPIC_COMPACTED` views and exact opaque Entry preservation；
- froze single-key generation publication, durable reader/protection handshake and physical root lifecycle；
- froze protected two-stage generation-zero prepare/head ordering and sync/async acknowledgement cuts；
- froze whole-index planner tiling plus current-policy fixed-point termination；
- froze 256-shard physical-root enumeration so MARKED/DELETING recovery never depends on object listing；
- froze 64-shard registered-stream discovery as a liveness hint, with projection/head/index remaining truth；
- froze the new module/dependency boundary and M1-M6 delivery order。

### 2.2 Gate conclusion

The protocol permits F5/F6/F8 to extend references/views without remapping offsets or making projection/task/GC a new
correctness owner. No implementation-blocking open decision remains. Implementation must not weaken the design to
avoid recovery checkpoint or durable read pins.

`nereus-materialization` module scaffold adds `build.gradle.kts` now, then M2/M3 add implementation classes. Add the
module to `settings.gradle.kts` and `nereus-bom`；dependency audit enforces
`materialization -> core` and forbids `core -> materialization` or Pulsar imports.

`ObjectProtectionIdentity` lives with the Oxia store/key identity rather than in `nereus-core` because
`PhysicalObjectMetadataStore` uses it directly and metadata must not depend on core. Core protection managers reuse
that protocol-neutral metadata identity; this preserves the documented acyclic dependency direction.

vectors、all 64 partition keys、strict continuation bounds and response-loss idempotence. Store contract tests run
unchanged against fake and real adapters；physical-root tests additionally freeze all 256 first-hash-byte shards、
root-only pagination and same-object root/lease/protection partition equality.

Ordinary gate compiles/tests M1 modules、both integration source sets and contract/dependency/doc/source-lock/guarded-
PUT audits. Final gate adds focused real Oxia slash-aware fixed-depth range/CAS/pagination/conditional-delete coverage
and pinned LocalStack SDK-response/exact-byte upload、list、HEAD identity and conditional-delete compatibility tests.
Both passed on 2026-07-15. M1 does not publish a higher generation or delete a product object.

No compacted Parquet production reader is required until M3；M2 tests use exact test readers, including one that
checks LocalStack object bytes, and prove the publication/resolver contract independently of the future compacted
file format.

Required assertions：unique generations with valid gaps；allocation-response loss plus interleaving can burn only
unattached gaps and exactly one task-attached G may create an index；PREPARED invisible；one CAS publication point；task/checkpoint
never visible；highest covering generation；same-view fallback only；exact index/root post-pin revalidation；unknown
format fails closed；stale cache/watch loss cannot hide a higher generation or a fresh fallback；old generation-zero
goldens still resolve.

### 4.3 Gates

```text
./gradlew phase4M2Check
./gradlew phase4M2FinalCheck --rerun-tasks
```

Final adds independent-runtime real Oxia allocation/publication/response-loss and LocalStack pin/fallback fixtures. Physical
delete stays disabled and all source objects remain protected. Both gates passed on 2026-07-15；the final gate was
also run with `--rerun-tasks` so the real-service evidence was not satisfied from Gradle cache.

`nereus-core` registers `ParquetCompactedTargetReader` through the exact NCP1 reader key at product composition.
The internal reader call carries the selected `StreamId` in addition to `ResolvedRange` so a self-consistent object
from another stream cannot pass merely because the old generic resolved-range shape omitted stream identity.

Pulsar Entry round trip includes unbatched、compressed、batched、properties、ordering key and exact middle-batch
MessageId bytes. Worker tests reject parse/re-encode even when decoded messages are semantically equal.
Planner fixed-point tests run repeated full registry passes：generation-zero/old-policy sources produce bounded work,
one healthy current-policy higher generation produces none, eligible multi-source merge produces exactly one new task,
and the post-publication pass produces no semantically identical higher generation.
Overlap-tiling tests permute nested/crossing concurrent generations and prove the bounded DAG chooses the same
gap-free whole-index path without clipping、duplicating offsets or depending on scan return order.

### 5.3 Gates

```text
./gradlew phase4M3Check
./gradlew phase4M3FinalCheck --rerun-tasks
```

Final runs real Oxia task claims and LocalStack full upload/footer/range read, two independent workers, every
upload/output/publish crash cut, all-shard registry pagination/watch loss, fresh-process recovery of an unloaded
stream whose committed head has no task, and full output byte comparison. It may publish higher generations only
with the test activation guard；production rollout remains disabled by default.

Both gates passed on 2026-07-15；the final gate was run with `--rerun-tasks`. `MaterializationWorkerOxiaS3IntegrationTest`
proves two independent worker runtimes converge on one durable attempt/output、a fresh process reuses the exact
published Parquet bytes, and a lost `OUTPUT_READY` CAS response reloads the frozen output. Deterministic failure/model
tests cover the remaining crash cuts, and `RegisteredMaterializationStreamScannerTest` forces page-size-one scans over
two registrations in every shard, repeats with a fresh scanner, and separately converges an unowned committed head
with no durable task. F4-M3 is complete/final-gated；M4 is the next implementation milestone.

## 6. F4-M4 — Recovery Checkpoint, Retirement, and GC

> Current status：in progress. Checkpoints A–R implement NRC1/protected append/recovery、checkpoint replay/index repair、
> retirement metadata、bounded GC plan/root/journal fencing、root-authenticated destructive recovery、typed source
> retirement and all view/trim eligibility paths. Checkpoint S implements durable generation activation metadata；
> checkpoint T implements the future sentinel、activation-gated full registration scope and affected/ownerless variants
> of all five reference domains. Checkpoint U implements persisted dual-absence DELETED-root/Phase 1 audit retirement.
> Checkpoint V implements the guarded/protected/pinned cursor-snapshot new-write frontier and its production
> physical/protection/read-pin wiring. Checkpoint W implements strict NPR1 projection authority and the stable
> physical-root/cursor-root live-reference backfill plus dual activation proofs.
> Checkpoint AJ now implements complete bounded cursor-snapshot candidate discovery and the post-drain full-inventory
> callback immediately before delete intent. Checkpoint AK adds restart-stable evidence/recovery、exact MARKED rollback
> and the cursor mark/drain/DELETING/source-retirement adapter in a provider-owned six-domain runtime. Checkpoint AL
> adds all current V1 writer key inverses plus complete known-prefix inventory and exact missing-root registration.
> Checkpoint AM adds exact deleted-stream/projection/F3 authority capture, bounded workflow/root drain and
> registration-last conditional retirement. Checkpoint AN adds the strict metadata-first physical-root/registration/
> inventory pass, exhaustive root lifecycle routing, restart-safe generic ownerless execution and non-overlapping
> fixed-delay provider composition. Checkpoint AO maps the complete physical-GC broker configuration and makes the
> provider consume the same cross-validated lease/protection/orphan values. Checkpoint AP implements the real
> configured-scope object-store capability probe without persisting or activating its digest. Product composition of
> Checkpoint AQ composes cursor/physical coverage plus capability proof into atomic physical-delete activation.
> Checkpoint AR installs that path in provider/Pulsar and exact-scope restart fencing. Checkpoint AS unifies the
> activation/GC ownerless-reference interpretation and proves one real Oxia/LocalStack destructive restart slice.
> Checkpoint AT adds real post-DELETE/pre-DELETED-root-CAS process-death recovery from durable DELETING authority.
> Checkpoint AU adds real applied-DELETED-root-CAS response-loss recovery and exact no-repeat-DELETE evidence.
> Checkpoint AV adds deterministic real two-worker DELETING-CAS contention and shared-intent delete convergence.
> The remaining destructive/scale scenarios and final M4 gate remain before F4-M4 can be called complete.
> Checkpoint X separately starts M5's rollout frontier：new/create/open/recreate topics cannot return before exact
> durable registration. Checkpoint Y publishes/verifies the generation broker capability and stable readiness
> identity. Checkpoint Z implements the cold-topic traversal/report, but no durable coverage proof、marker or product
> activation permit is produced yet.

The GC model enumerates all reader/protection/mark/delete orderings for a small state space. Failure tests kill after
every conditional metadata delete and object delete response. Cursor snapshot tests cover ACTIVE plus both pending F3
retention lifecycles and owner/root changes during the drain wait. Tombstone tests cover both exact HEAD-absence
windows, every L0 audit/root conditional-delete response-loss cut and a guarded provider retry racing final root
retirement.

`phase4M4CheckpointCheck` is deliberately narrower than the milestone gates：it verifies the implemented NRC1
streaming/strict-read/canonical-metadata boundary and all earlier M3 prerequisites. It must not be cited as evidence
that recovery-root publication、source retirement or any physical deletion path is enabled.

`phase4M4ProtectedAppendCheck` extends that checkpoint chain with the exact two-stage metadata surface、the one raw
core caller rule、ordinary/recovery ordering、production shared-Oxia composition、unit checks and compilation of every
affected real-service source set. It is checkpoint-B evidence only；it does not run or imply the later recovery-root、
retirement、GC or M4 final-service scenarios.

`phase4M4RecoveryRootCheck` extends checkpoint B with anchor-aware tail/planning contracts, bounded NRC1 publication
enumeration, guarded upload/root-CAS sequencing, digest-role separation and restart-safe permanent-protection repair.
It includes focused lost-response/process-death tests and the affected module checks. It is checkpoint-D evidence；it
does not imply that checkpoint-aware append replay/index repair、source retirement、physical/cursor GC or the
Docker-backed M4 final gate is available.

`phase4M4CheckpointReplayCheck` extends checkpoint D with sparse offset lookup、shared live/NRC1 append-record
validation、root-change restart、durable read-pin lifetime and the terminal replay integration seam. It is checkpoint-E
evidence only；the default runtime does not select the checkpoint reader until the later F4 composition checkpoint,
and index repair、retirement、GC and delete enablement remain unavailable.

`phase4M4CheckpointIndexRepairCheck` extends checkpoint E with the exact committed-index restore contract、raw-record
versus durable-envelope digest separation、root-stable NRC1 pin/lookup、highest healthy ACTIVE target selection、
root-owned target protection、activation/trim/root revalidation and resolver fresh rescan. It covers index retirement,
root-at-pin change, trim no-write and lease cleanup. It is checkpoint-F evidence only；the default runtime composition
still selects the live-only repair adapter, and source/index retirement、physical/cursor GC and all delete enablement
remain unavailable.

`phase4M4RetirementMetadataCheck` extends checkpoint F with the dedicated read-before-delete source/object-audit
adapters. It proves legacy/generic generation-zero index、marker and commit-node separation；canonical key/partition、
encoded version、captured Oxia version and exact stored-envelope SHA checks；hydrated object audits；
references-before-manifest ordering；and fail-closed missing/response-loss behavior. It deliberately provides no
source-retirement plan、root MARK/DRAIN/DELETING transition、domain proof、object-store delete or runtime composition,
so it is checkpoint-G evidence only.

`phase4M4GcPlanCheck` extends checkpoint G with exact-millisecond/cross-lifetime configuration validation、safe
deadline overflow、ACTIVE-root candidate construction、secure non-authorizing ids and canonical complete-domain plan
digests. It proves configured bounds cannot be implemented by truncation, unrelated-object protections cannot enter a
MARK digest, protection owner/value/version/envelope drift changes that digest, and a response-loss reload must match
exact root object/attempt/digest/version/epoch. Restart recovery uses the current MARKED version and does not invent a
previous or adjacent Oxia version. `GcPlan` has no
durable codec and this gate invokes no root CAS or delete primitive；it is checkpoint-H evidence only.

`phase4M4RootFenceCheck` extends checkpoint H with the canonical unique domain registry、explicit
veto/incomplete/limit blockers、shared-deadline collection/revalidation、mandatory typed metadata reload and exact
root CAS recovery. It proves premature/disabled/dry-run paths do not mutate；MARK binds domain/protection/metadata
facts；drain waits through grace and paged reader leases；protection owner/version、metadata version/envelope or domain
authority drift unmarks before any destructive side effect；lost MARK/unmark/DELETING responses and a fresh MARKED
recovery candidate converge only by exact root reload. The scanner test forces page size one across all 256 shards and
checks exact lifecycle counts、visitor-failure re-entry and borrowed-resource close semantics. A contract-surface
check rejects any source/audit/protection/object delete dependency in the collector. This is checkpoint-I evidence
only：the terminal result is durable `DELETING` intent, concrete domains/runtime composition and every destructive
side effect remain absent.

`phase4M4ReferenceDomainsCheck` extends checkpoint I with query-bound `stillMatches` re-scans and an exact invariant
that every retained domain reference is paired with the same planned metadata removal key、Oxia version and durable
value SHA. It proves both-view generation scans、DRAINING-only higher-generation eligibility、optional recovery-root
plus complete live-tail authorities、active materialization-task vetoes、bounded fail-closed accumulation and
ownerless fail-closed behavior without treating stream registrations as truth. This is checkpoint-J evidence only；
at that boundary projection/cursor/future-sentinel and ownerless-global domains、source retirement、physical deletion
and runtime composition remained absent.

`phase4M4ManagedLedgerDomainsCheck` extends checkpoint J with the core shared bounded/canonical builder、composed F2
cursor/generation marker rules、monotonic generation-marker CAS and exact per-stream binding/current-topic authority
lookup. It proves stored-envelope/Oxia-version binding、same-incarnation marker/DELETED/DELETING decisions、strictly
newer incarnation unaddressability、topic-published-before-binding-repair fail-closed behavior、complete paged F3
retention/cursor scans、live snapshot-root veto、pending-retention and projection drift、configured overflow and
ownerless fail-closed behavior. The module-boundary gate rejects a managed-ledger -> materialization dependency. This
is checkpoint-K evidence only：the M5 activation record/registration barrier, future sentinel/ownerless-global proof、
source retirement、physical deletion and runtime composition remain absent.

`phase4M4RetirementJournalCheck` extends checkpoint K with the protocol foundation and durable journal path. Module
tests prove codec/factory round
trips、record contradictions、full-snapshot/compact-proof digest equality、fixed-depth keyspace and production/fake
store parity、page-size-one restart reload、manifest-last sealing, create-response-loss convergence and no manifest
when an entry is missing. Collector tests prove exact PREPARE completes before activation/root CAS, every PREPARE
failure leaves the root ACTIVE, both drain admission and final intent fence reload the same root-authenticated
snapshot, and a missing final snapshot leaves the root MARKED. This is checkpoint-L ordinary evidence only：it stops
at DELETING intent and does not enable source/protection/metadata/object deletion or replace the M4 final gate.

`phase4M4DestructiveRecoveryCheck` extends checkpoint L with checkpoint M's first root-authenticated recovery slice.
It verifies that a matching sealed journal is mandatory before destructive work, generic removal types dispatch only
through an explicitly registered type-owned handler, an exact immutable object is HEADed/deleted under the shared
deadline, and the exact attempt alone can CAS `DELETING -> DELETED`. Focused tests cover ordinary deletion、an already
absent object under matching authority、same-record `DELETED` restart, and missing-journal failure before object access.
At checkpoint M the gate did not claim production source-metadata handlers, protection/metadata response-loss
coverage、runtime composition、future-sentinel/ownerless-global domains、cursor completion or final M4 deletion
enablement.

`phase4M4GenerationRetirementCheck` extends checkpoint M through checkpoint R. API/metadata tests freeze canonical
inverse key decoding、encoded stream ids、both view namespaces、fixed depth/current-cluster round trips, plus exact-key
legacy/generic marker/commit value-to-key reconstruction. Handler tests prove exact generation-zero index/marker/
commit deletion、delete-response-loss absence classification、DRAINING-only higher retirement、attempt+reference-set-
bound deterministic RETIRED recovery、CAS-response-loss convergence and drift rejection. Source-plan tests require an
unchanged recovery root, one covering NRC1 entry, identical canonical commit SHA/source/index/marker facts and exact
candidate-bound revalidator output；root drift、a different NRC1 canonical commit and an existing but unbound extra
source removal fail closed. Plan tests require reference/removal
type equality. Coordinator tests force `maxConcurrentDeletes=1`, remove the journal before batch two or the physical
fence, and prove no later handler/object call occurs. Checkpoint P extends the same ordinary gate with strict one-row
NRC1 publication resolution、canonical raw/durable digest separation、current exact COMMITTED index binding、another-
object ACTIVE root/slice proof and final exact index/root reload. Tests reject a QUARANTINED index、MARKED root and
either wrapper changing during freeze. Checkpoint Q further requires a whole-source NRC1 offset/commit/cumulative/
count/schema tiling, a strictly newer current COMMITTED/ACTIVE replacement for every entry, and exact replacement/
root/source reload before candidate-root-fenced `COMMITTED/QUARANTINED -> DRAINING`. Tests cover both source
lifecycles、already-DRAINING reproof、dry-run zero reads、incomplete tiling、replacement-root drift、candidate-root final
fence and CAS response loss；the source planner repeats the proof before freezing a DRAINING removal.
Checkpoint R adds the exact completed-trim alternative for generation-zero and either higher view, including
source/full-stream-snapshot/recovery-root rereads. For untrimmed TOPIC_COMPACTED sources it requires a strictly newer
current same-view index that covers offset/commit/cumulative bounds with matching payload/projection, plus another-
object `ACTIVE/TOPIC_COMPACTED` root and final index/root/source reload. Tests cover successful same-view pre-drain and
DRAINING plan reproof、MARKED replacement veto、trim success/drift and a grace result before any metadata/root read.
At checkpoint R, future/global domains、runtime composition、cursor/root/audit retirement and the final M4 gate
remained pending；checkpoints S/T close the activation/global-domain portion and checkpoint U closes DELETED-root audit
retirement only.

`phase4M4ActivationMetadataCheck` extends the ordinary checkpoint chain with checkpoint S's single-key cluster
authority foundation. It audits the exact key/partition、record fields and contradictions、explicit codec registration、
monotonic transition guard、production Oxia create/CAS/reload behavior and three frozen golden vectors. The focused
contract test proves two runtime adapters converge on one PREPARED value, then advance publication and deletion facts
without accepting stale versions or domain/capability regression. This gate does not execute any backfill、install the
future sentinel、prove ownerless global absence or enable production capability bits.

`phase4M4GlobalDomainsCheck` extends checkpoint S with checkpoint T. It audits the core global-scope contract、
read-only activation lookup、exact deletion-ready/domain-set admission、all 64 registration shards、pagination
progress、post-scan activation reload、authority overflow and the future sentinel. Focused tests prove activation
absence never creates authority、unknown installed domains and publication-only rollout veto、page-size-one global
enumeration is canonical, activation drift invalidates revalidation, and generation/append/task/projection/cursor
domains all repeat their exact per-stream scans for ownerless queries. This gate does not execute the backfill/broker
barrier or install production runtime deletion.

`phase4M4TombstoneRetirementCheck` extends checkpoint T with checkpoint U. It audits the exact DELETED input、
disabled/dry-run no-mutation paths、strict audit/orphan-plus-skew boundaries、persisted first-absence proof、reader and
protection handle veto、owner/reference versus generic domain veto classification、authority-digest window restart、
exact late-object delete/retry handling、mismatched-byte quarantine、Phase 1 references-before-manifest conditional
retirement and root-last version+durable-SHA delete. Focused tests force audit/root/object delete response loss and an
owner appearing before the late-PUT provider delete. This gate still does not run physical-root backfill、cursor
snapshot GC、object inventory、registration retirement、production runtime composition or the real-service M4 final
scenarios. The ordinary gate passed on 2026-07-16.

`phase4M4CursorProtectionCheck` extends checkpoint U with checkpoint V. It audits the exact captured ACTIVE cursor
authority、guarded replayable PUT before every provider attempt、ACTIVE physical-root plus bounded pending proof、
`prepareWrite -> cursor CAS -> completeWrite` visibility ordering、permanent-before-pending-release and
lease-before-range-IO. Focused tests prove owner/root drift blocks upload、cursor-CAS response loss is repaired from
the live snapshot reference、read/decode failures still release the durable lease、collision never overwrites bytes
and borrowed stores/managers are not closed by the snapshot store. It also compiles the migrated real-S3 and real
Oxia/S3 source sets and verifies production provider/runtime ownership. This gate does not implement legacy
physical-root/cursor inventory backfill、`CursorSnapshotGcScanner` candidate/deletion logic、broker activation barrier、
object inventory、registration retirement or production deletion. The ordinary gate plus
`cursorS3IntegrationTest` and `cursorM2IntegrationTest --rerun-tasks` passed on 2026-07-16.

`phase4M4PhysicalRootBackfillCheck` extends checkpoint V with checkpoint W. It audits strict NPR1 projection
identity、the protocol-neutral live/non-live projection authority capture、same-epoch completed registration-proof
admission、all 64 registry shards、bounded deterministic stream concurrency、recovery-root-anchored commit traversal、
complete generation-zero index traversal、F3 retention/cursor inventory、HEAD-before-root and exact owner-bound
`REACHABLE_APPEND`/`VISIBLE_GENERATION`/`CURSOR_SNAPSHOT_ROOT` handshakes. Final admission reloads registration、L0
snapshot、projection、recovery root/head and cursor inventory before publishing the two coverage proofs. Focused tests
cover an empty stable registry、activation-CAS response loss、one Object-WAL shared by a reachable commit and visible
index、a canonical NCS1 cursor snapshot with ETag, and fail-closed registration preconditions. Listing is forbidden as
coverage evidence. This ordinary checkpoint does not implement the broker-side cold-topic registration backfill or
capability barrier, enable delete bits, schedule `CursorSnapshotGcScanner`, enumerate orphan object inventory, retire
registrations, or run the real-service destructive final scenarios. The ordinary gate passed with
`--rerun-tasks` on 2026-07-16.

`phase4M4CursorSnapshotGcCheck` extends checkpoint W with checkpoint AJ. It audits strict NCS key inversion、complete
retention/cursor/object/protection pagination with an exact 10,000-value ceiling、listing age plus clock-skew
eligibility、ACTIVE cursor-snapshot root/list identity、owner-bound permanent and skew-expired pending protection
classification、canonical candidate/query evidence and one-at-a-time bounded visitation. It also audits the central
collector's candidate-kind callback after the second reader/protection/metadata drain and before the final
MARKED-root/journal/activation fence. Focused local-object-store tests prove exact candidate emission、unchanged
MARKED-successor revalidation、cursor-owner drift rejection、strict pending expiry and fail-closed inventory overflow；
collector tests prove false revalidation unmarks while a revalidation failure retains MARKED. The scanner contains no
root CAS、protection removal or object-delete call. This ordinary checkpoint does not schedule the scanner、enable the
cursor coverage/delete bits、compose destructive recovery、enumerate other orphan prefixes、retire registrations or
run the real-service M4 final scenarios.
The aggregate gate passed with `--rerun-tasks` on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 against locked Pulsar
`master@330eeeb3fa9903ed0123c2a0e261d403c32f0a59`; the root build and inherited nested Pulsar regression each
reported 138 actionable tasks.

`phase4M4CursorGcExecutionCheck` extends checkpoint AJ with checkpoint AK. It rejects ephemeral discovery time and
ACTIVE-wrapper metadata from candidate evidence, proves exact MARKED reconstruction after a fresh scanner process,
and checks that complete drift conditionally unmarks while uncertain inventory retains MARKED. It audits the explicit
`mark -> drain/final revalidation -> DELETING -> source retirement` adapter, restart from MARKED or DELETING, the exact
six-domain registry、durable journal、empty cursor plan metadata-removal contract、typed physical-GC configuration and
provider/managed-ledger ownership；checkpoint AN later extends the shared source-retirement runtime with all four
generation-zero/higher-generation handlers. Focused tests complete the exact protection/object deletion path only under an
explicit enabled non-dry-run test configuration and prove changed authority never deletes bytes. The production
safe-default runtime schedules no scan, and the existing broker bridge still supplies `enabled=false, dryRun=true`；
this gate does not publish coverage/delete bits, map broker GC knobs, inventory missing-root objects, retire stream
registrations or satisfy the real-service destructive final scenarios.
The aggregate gate passed with `--rerun-tasks` on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 against locked Pulsar

nested Pulsar regression reported 138 actionable tasks.

`phase4M4ObjectInventoryCheck` extends checkpoint AK with checkpoint AL. It audits canonical, non-overlapping prefixes
and strict inverses for Object-WAL、both compacted views、NRC1 and NCS1；a listed key cannot become metadata merely by
prefix membership. The scanner performs a complete ordered pass, prechecks the root, enforces listing age plus clock
skew, requires exact HEAD key/length/optional ETag with positive CRC32C identity, rechecks root absence and either
reports `WOULD_REGISTER` or creates one exact ACTIVE root with a second full orphan grace. Create-response loss
converges only through equality with that complete desired root. Every listed value receives one outcome；malformed、
young、stale、HEAD-mismatched and root-conflicting values cause no mutation. The scanner exposes no delete operation,
is only owned—not scheduled—by `Phase4PhysicalGcRuntime`, and therefore does not enable production deletion. This
ordinary gate does not include the later checkpoint-AM registration retirement, periodic lifecycle routing、broker physical-GC mapping/
activation or the real-service destructive final scenarios.
The aggregate gate passed with `--rerun-tasks` on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 against locked Pulsar
`master@330eeeb3fa9903ed0123c2a0e261d403c32f0a59`；the root build executed 131 actionable tasks and the inherited
nested Pulsar regression reported 138 actionable tasks（3 executed、135 up-to-date）。

`phase4M4RegistrationRetirementCheck` extends checkpoint AL with checkpoint AM. It audits the protocol-neutral exact
per-stream external-reference snapshot and the managed-ledger F3 retention/cursor authority, including stable NPR1
identity、complete pagination、ACTIVE retention、DELETED-only cursors and configured authority overflow. The bounded
coordinator requires exact DELETED L0、non-live projection、reference-free F3 authority、terminal/audit-grace-expired
tasks and higher indexes, and an empty post-anchor recovery tail. It removes only owner-scoped protections before the
matching terminal index/task/root, drains checkpoint/stats/sequence metadata, rescans every prefix, re-captures all
authorities and conditionally removes the registration last. Focused tests cover non-terminal/live-index/audit-grace
blocks, empty-root and final-registration response loss, a published workflow with three protections and two indexes,
and a real non-empty NRC1 root with checkpoint-object/target protections. They explicitly retain the physical roots;
the coordinator exposes no object/root delete. Periodic registration scheduling、broker physical-GC mapping/
activation and real-service destructive final scenarios remain outside this ordinary gate.
The aggregate gate passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 against locked Pulsar
`master@330eeeb3fa9903ed0123c2a0e261d403c32f0a59`; the root build reported 132 actionable tasks（68 executed）and
the inherited nested Pulsar regression reported 138 actionable tasks（3 executed）.

`phase4M4LifecycleSchedulingCheck` extends checkpoint AM with checkpoint AN. It audits the exhaustive ordered
registration scanner, strict `root -> registration -> inventory` pass, immediate/fixed-delay scheduling、non-overlap、
hint coalescing and bounded close. It freezes the root-state router and generic ownerless path：ACTIVE candidates still
enter the central six-domain proof, MARKED reconstructs exact evidence after restart, DELETING resumes the durable
journal, DELETED enters dual-absence tombstone retirement and QUARANTINED is inert. It also audits the complete
generation-zero/higher-generation metadata-retirement registry、source/audit store ownership and provider's enabled-only
startup boundary. The current broker bridge remains `enabled=false, dryRun=true`；this ordinary gate neither maps a
physical-GC knob nor claims coverage/delete activation or the real Oxia/LocalStack destructive scenarios.
The aggregate gate passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 against locked Pulsar
`master@330eeeb3fa9903ed0123c2a0e261d403c32f0a59`; the root build reported 133 actionable tasks（65 executed）and
the inherited nested Pulsar regression reported 138 actionable tasks（3 executed）.

`phase4M4PhysicalGcConfigCheck` extends checkpoint AN with checkpoint AO. It audits all 17 Pulsar broker fields and
their safe defaults, the exact `NereusBrokerStorageConfiguration -> PhysicalGcConfig` mapping, constructor/cross-config
bounds, and the provider's single-source use of pending-protection、reader-lease、clock-skew and orphan-grace values.
Its locked Pulsar focused test proves default `enabled=false, dryRun=true`, explicit `enabled=true, dryRun=false`
mutation admission, full value conversion, oversized page rejection and lease/operation-timeout rejection. The gate
does not produce either coverage proof, does not certify the object-store delete capability, and cannot set activation
delete bits；those remain separate durable authorities. The source boundary is
`master@42a4bfd7dfae1d0b23e07dd2b9ebb59f0344782f`. The aggregate gate passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21；the root
build reported 144 actionable tasks（63 executed）and the locked Pulsar focused/style build reported 141 actionable
tasks（all executed）.

`phase4M4ObjectStoreCapabilityCheck` extends checkpoint AO with checkpoint AP. It audits the isolated base32 run/key
namespace、single checked deadline、guarded if-absent canary PUT、exact CRC32C/length/non-empty-ETag HEAD、complete
single-page LIST with last-modified identity、ETag-bound exact DELETE、lost PUT/DELETE response recovery through exact
facts、idempotent `ALREADY_ABSENT` and final LIST absence. The deterministic SHA-256 binds provider class、normalized
endpoint、region、bucket、logical prefix、path-style and the frozen V1 semantics while a contract audit rejects any
credential/token input. Focused tests prove stable same-scope identity, scope-change identity, response-loss recovery,
incomplete-list fail-closed behavior and exact cleanup. This ordinary gate does not run the physical/cursor backfill,
persist `objectStoreCapabilitySha256`, set either deletion bit or prove real S3/Oxia destructive recovery. Those remain
the next product-activation and final-service checkpoints. The aggregate gate passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21
against locked Pulsar `master@42a4bfd7dfae1d0b23e07dd2b9ebb59f0344782f`；the root build reported 145 actionable
tasks（69 executed）and the inherited focused Pulsar build reported 141 actionable tasks（all executed）.

`phase4M4PhysicalDeletionActivationCheck` extends AQ with checkpoint AR. It audits the managed-ledger request/result
surface, ordered W-backfill/AP-canary coordinator, atomic dual-bit CAS, shared provider capability digest、factory
exposure and the three startup modes. Focused startup tests prove absent/publication-only authority defers mutation,
exact durable scope resumes recovery, and scope/domain drift fails non-retryably. The locked Pulsar test freezes
`zero failures -> publication -> optional physical activation` ordering, default/dry-run non-invocation and failure
propagation through the original completion promise. The source boundary is
`master@c59da789e88df2b57829de3277c60194b44fceb6`. The aggregate gate passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 with 147
root actionable tasks；the explicitly serialized Pulsar configuration and deletion-activation builds passed with
141 and 129 actionable tasks respectively. This ordinary gate does not replace the real Oxia/LocalStack
destructive restart、response-loss、multi-broker and scale final gate.

`phase4M4PhysicalDeletionIntegrationCheck` is checkpoint AS, the first real-service destructive/restart gate slice.
Its contract audit requires `Phase4GcReferenceDomainAssembly` to build the registered-stream global scope and
projection domain from the exact typed bounds, requires the provider to pass that projection instance to activation
and the same assembly to GC, and rejects a provider-local unsupported ownerless scope. The dedicated Testcontainers
source set pins four-shard `oxia/oxia:0.16.3` and `localstack/localstack:4.14.0` S3 without Docker auto-disable. It
proves publication-only startup deferral、real W coverage/AP canary plus atomic activation、ownerless ACTIVE -> MARKED,
non-retryable wrong-prefix restart fencing, and correct-scope MARKED recovery with object LIST forced empty. The real
target DELETE succeeds but its first response is lost；HEAD absence drives durable DELETED convergence. The focused
task passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 and Docker 28.5.2 with 38 executed tasks. The aggregate gate composes the AR
gate、this real-service task、the AS contract audit and documentation/module/source-lock checks；it passed against
locked Pulsar `c59da789e88df2b57829de3277c60194b44fceb6` with 141 actionable tasks（68 executed）。

`phase4M4PostDeleteCrashRecoveryCheck` is checkpoint AT. Its real-service method first obtains durable dual-bit
authority and a MARKED ownerless compacted root. After grace, the second process delegates the exact object DELETE to
LocalStack and records completion only from the real SDK result；a physical-metadata proxy then intercepts only the
same object's DELETED replacement after that fact and fails before invoking Oxia CAS. A completion future exposes the
cut without sleeps. At the process boundary, HEAD is absent and the root is still durable DELETING. A third independent
runtime reloads the sealed journal from real Oxia, accepts absence only under the unchanged attempt/digest and CASes
the root to DELETED without LIST or old callbacks. The focused method passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 and Docker
28.5.2 with 47 executed tasks. The AT aggregate adds a static audit that requires this exact ordering and rejects
sleep-based coordination. It passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 and Docker 28.5.2 against locked Pulsar
`c59da789e88df2b57829de3277c60194b44fceb6`；the root build reported 151 actionable tasks（66 executed、85 up-to-
date），and the two pinned Pulsar source-set builds executed 132/132 and 129/129 tasks.

`phase4M4DeletedCasResponseLossCheck` is checkpoint AU. Its real-service method first establishes the same activated
MARKED ownerless root and waits through drain grace. A target wrapper records the exact LocalStack DELETE completion
and count. The physical-store proxy delegates the matching DELETED replacement CAS to real Oxia and only after that
future succeeds returns a retriable timeout. Production `completeDeletedRoot` follows its uncertain-CAS branch, reloads
the exact durable replacement and completes without reissuing DELETE. A separately assembled runtime scans the same
DELETED root and also issues no DELETE. The focused method passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 and Docker 28.5.2 with
47 executed tasks. The AU aggregate adds a static ordering audit and passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 and Docker
28.5.2 against locked Pulsar `c59da789e88df2b57829de3277c60194b44fceb6`；the root build reported 152 actionable
tasks（67 executed、85 up-to-date），and the two pinned Pulsar source-set builds executed 141/141 and 138/138 tasks.

`phase4M4TwoWorkerConvergenceCheck` is checkpoint AV. Its real-service method starts two separately assembled runtime
instances against the same durable MARKED root. A future barrier admits both exact DELETING replacement CAS calls to
Oxia together；one raw CAS succeeds and one fails, after which the loser must reload the complete same replacement.
A second barrier makes both recovery paths enter the same immutable target DELETE before either result returns. Both
exact idempotent operations complete, and both workers observe one equal durable DELETED root plus absent S3 bytes.
The focused method passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 and Docker 28.5.2 with 47 executed tasks. The AV aggregate adds a
static concurrency audit and passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 and Docker 28.5.2 against locked Pulsar
`c59da789e88df2b57829de3277c60194b44fceb6`; the root build reported 153 actionable tasks（68 executed、85 up-to-
date）, and its two serialized locked-Pulsar builds executed 141/141 and 129/129 tasks.

Checkpoint AV is deliberately not `phase4M4FinalCheck`. The final gate extends the real Oxia + LocalStack evidence to
two actual brokers with ownership/failover. It proves old commit/index/source deletion is
impossible before root checkpoint; after deletion, append replay/index repair/read use the checkpoint/higher target.
It also proves live-reference root/protection backfill, all-shard lifecycle recovery with empty object listing, 10,000
cursor roots, snapshot listing, process-death lease expiry and multi-stream object veto. It additionally proves that
both existing sync append and replay recovery establish `REACHABLE_APPEND` before head visibility and
`VISIBLE_GENERATION` before strict success, across every response-loss cut. Ten thousand deleted roots are reduced to
bounded audit metadata only after the long grace, while a stale first/retried PUT cannot resurrect a retired key.

`phase4M4AllShardRecoveryCheck` is checkpoint AW. Its real-service method generates one exact object/root per
`F4Keyspace.physicalObjectShard`, activates deletion, obtains 256 sealed MARKED roots and closes the originating
process. A non-running setup runtime converts only odd shards to the production-shaped DELETING value. A final fresh
runtime receives empty LIST pages yet its authoritative root scan observes 128 MARKED plus 128 DELETING roots and
converges all 256 through their sealed journals to DELETED and exact S3 absence.

The fixture found a real continuation mismatch before it passed. `ObjectInventoryScanner` formerly compared logical
keys across calls even though `ListObjectsResult` promises order only within one page and the S3 adapter's opaque
`nls1` cursor walks disjoint base64url prefixes. The scanner now validates the exact requested family prefix and
requires a non-terminal opaque token to differ from the supplied token. Unit tests accept descending logical order
across pages and reject an unchanged token. The focused AW method passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 and Docker 28.5.2
with 38 actionable tasks（2 executed、36 up-to-date）；the complete AS–AW real-service source set then passed with
47/47 executed tasks. The aggregate gate composes AV, that source set, materialization checks and a dedicated static
audit. It passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 and Docker 28.5.2 against locked Pulsar
`master@c59da789e88df2b57829de3277c60194b44fceb6`；the root build reported 154 actionable tasks（73 executed、81 up-to-
date）, and the two serialized locked-Pulsar builds executed 141/141 and 138/138 tasks.

Checkpoint AW is still not `phase4M4FinalCheck`. It closes item 47's all-shard/empty-list recovery portion only；the
one-shard and 10,000-root scale bounds, source/protection deletion cuts, late PUT/tombstone races and actual broker
ownership/failover remain mandatory.

```

Ordinary gate builds/publishes the F4 development artifacts and runs the exact clean local Pulsar source lock plus
focused fork tests/spotless. Final gate runs real two-broker Pulsar with real Oxia、pinned LocalStack and stock
BookKeeper coexistence. It proves projection-ref resolution、registration-before-marker crash cuts、async ack/read
repair、cold-topic backfill、policy trim、backlog eviction、capability rollout and source retirement without claiming a
Nereus BookKeeper profile.

`phase4M5RegistrationFrontierCheck` is the checkpoint-X precursor to those full M5 gates. It verifies the shared
projection-ref encoder、exact projection/L0 registration capture、idempotent create/monotonic hint refresh、
response-loss reload、final authority revalidation、open-return ordering and production shared-store ownership. It
does not modify the local Pulsar fork, advertise generation capability, activate a topic marker, enumerate cold
topics, or publish a cluster backfill proof. The ordinary gate passed with `--rerun-tasks` on 2026-07-16.

`phase4M5GenerationCapabilityCheck` is the checkpoint-Y precursor. It consumes the exact clean local fork
`master@bce3422a94edf01c483c15063c6879254b3ff03f`, audits the capability/readiness/invalidation surface, publishes
the existing Nereus F2 development composite, and runs broker spotless、checkstyle plus focused generation/cursor/
binding suites. The readiness identity is domain-separated SHA-256 over sorted persistent broker registry keys、
advertised broker ids、start timestamps and sorted required protocol pairs；the frozen two-broker fixture yields
epoch `4351585672493013605` and digest
`bc63f01d0aa01a65c7205625a2714f0246d8ba7e7b88b8a653137abbc719cc0d`. Registry notifications invalidate the
cache and a notification between equal snapshots fails closed. This gate does not enumerate cold topics、CAS the
registration backfill proof、activate a topic marker or enable publication/deletion. It passed with `--rerun-tasks`
on 2026-07-16.

`phase4M5RegistrationBackfillCheck` is the checkpoint-Z precursor. It consumes the current exact clean local fork
`master@bce3422a94edf01c483c15063c6879254b3ff03f`, publishes the Nereus development composite, audits the product
candidate and broker traversal/config/lifecycle surfaces, and runs managed-ledger plus Pulsar spotless、checkstyle and
focused suites. The traversal never loads/owns a topic；it sorts tenants/namespaces/topics, processes one namespace at
a time, batches topic work under the configured concurrency, captures strict NPR1 projection identity, performs
idempotent registration, re-reads binding and requires identical start/end readiness. The report hashes the full
canonical traversal, retains only the first 100 redacted failures and freezes coverage SHA
`2f234d6b9baa3a760460090850d22734f94cd72d51fd0f27706fda272fc01d7c`. This gate does not CAS the durable
`streamRegistrationBackfill` proof, activate a marker or enable publication/deletion. It passed with `--rerun-tasks`
on 2026-07-16.

`phase4M5RegistrationProofCheck` is the checkpoint-AA precursor. It consumes the current exact clean local fork,
publishes the Nereus development composite, inherits checkpoint Z's broker spotless/checkstyle/focused tests and adds
the exact proof contract-surface audit plus core/managed-ledger/adapter checks. The broker converts the complete
readiness identity without truncating the full digest, submits only a zero-failure report after final readiness
revalidation, and never owns the activation store. The product reacquires exact readiness, performs a bounded
response-loss-safe CAS, enforces same-epoch coverage immutability, resets dependent proof epochs on readiness advance
and rejects standalone advance after deletion enablement. The gate covers lost CAS responses and readiness
invalidation after CAS. It does not activate a topic marker or enable publication/deletion. It passed on 2026-07-16.

`phase4M5ActivationGuardCheck` is the checkpoint-AB precursor. It consumes the exact clean local fork
`master@bce3422a94edf01c483c15063c6879254b3ff03f`, publishes the current development composite and runs
core/managed-ledger/adapter checks plus broker-common/broker spotless、checkstyle and
`NereusBrokerStorageConfigurationTest`. The managed-ledger guard requires one exact ACTIVE cluster record carrying
the current readiness epoch、complete stream-registration proof and the canonical six-domain set whose frozen digest
is `5b29cf6df71cce198d01299f5bd740f0f123c601e12f04d8251d336a6a2a8c4d`. Live proofs bind strict NPR1
projection、topic metadata version、L0 identity/profile and registration；first marker activation is disabled unless
the explicit broker switch is true and response loss converges only from exact reload. Physical delete additionally
requires the current delete bits/backfills/object-store capability and the exact non-vetoed
`projection-generation-v1` snapshot. Revalidation fails closed on readiness、activation、topic or domain drift. This
gate does not advance the cluster record to ACTIVE and does not yet install the guard at mutation call sites, so
async publication、logical trim and physical deletion remain unavailable. It passed on 2026-07-16.

`phase4M5PublicationActivationCheck` is the checkpoint-AC precursor. It consumes the exact clean local fork
`master@bce3422a94edf01c483c15063c6879254b3ff03f`, publishes the current development composite and runs
core/managed-ledger/adapter checks plus broker spotless、checkstyle、
`NereusGenerationRegistrationBackfillTest` and
`NereusManagedLedgerStorageGenerationActivationTest`. The product coordinator makes no first write while the switch
is false, then requires current exact broker readiness、a same-epoch completed stream-registration proof and the
canonical six-domain set before its only transition：
`PREPARED -> ACTIVE(publication=true, physicalDelete=false, cursorSnapshotDelete=false)`. Condition conflicts retry
from the reloaded PREPARED value；concurrent success or a lost CAS response converges only from a valid durable ACTIVE
record. Cached readiness and ACTIVE authority are revalidated after CAS. Broker backfill completion waits for this
coordinator only when the report is zero-failure and the explicit switch is true；disabled/failure reports never call
it, and activation failure fails the returned promise. This gate does not set a topic marker or admit any
task/index/checkpoint/trim/delete mutation. It passed on 2026-07-16.

`phase4M5AsyncObjectWalCheck` is the checkpoint-AD precursor. It inherits the complete checkpoint-AC rollout chain,
then audits and tests the core-only opt-in Phase 4 Object-WAL execution boundary. The gate proves that legacy
constructors still install `Phase15StorageProfileResolver`、BookKeeper profiles remain rejected before IO、
`WAL_DURABLE` returns only after protected stable head but before generation-zero completion、strict durability waits
for exact `VISIBLE_GENERATION` protection、secondary failure cannot revoke an acknowledgement、restart/live read
repair materializes and protects the exact reachable commit、trim wins without creating a new index, and
NRC1-covered offsets are not regenerated as generation zero. It does not install the resolver in the production
provider, create the first topic marker, apply lag admission, or claim async Pulsar policy support.

Checkpoint AE closes the next product-neutral cut without claiming production rollout. It adds exact sync/async
Object-WAL profile persistence across F2 create/open/append, inserts activation/first-marker proof plus final
revalidation and authoritative lag admission into the per-stream append lane before writer preparation, and derives
lag from rebuilt current-policy COMMITTED coverage rather than tasks/checkpoint counters. Focused tests cover blocked
pre-I/O admission、one-delay remeasurement、records/bytes/age rejection、disabled thresholds、projection/profile
contradictions、proof revalidation、exact live-tail bytes/age and ahead-checkpoint rejection. On 2026-07-16 the full
`:nereus-core:test :nereus-metadata-oxia:test :nereus-managed-ledger:test :nereus-materialization:test` regression
passed.

Checkpoint AF completes the production composition cut. `Phase4ObjectWalRuntime` owns the shared read-target
registry、checkpoint replay/index repair、generation-zero source repair、lag reader and background materialization
service；`DefaultNereusRuntimeProvider` installs it together with the async admission guard and passes the exact read
components into `DefaultStreamStorage`. The runtime starts before broker storage is returned and closes before
generation/Oxia/ObjectStore resources. The locked Pulsar mapper persists only exact sync/async Object-WAL profile
names, constructs the complete validated `MaterializationConfig`, appends processRunId to the staging base and keeps
sync as the default. Focused Nereus module tests and `NereusBrokerStorageConfigurationTest` passed on 2026-07-16.
Retention/admin and destructive GC composition remain outside this checkpoint.

`phase4M5RetentionPlannerCheck` is the checkpoint-AG precursor. It inherits the complete checkpoint-AD chain, audits
the exact retention contract surface and runs `:nereus-managed-ledger:check`. The planner captures a maximum of 4,096
canonical stats facts, verifies each exact source-index key/version/durable SHA, applies stock time-OR-size policy at
verified range boundaries, and requires two identical captures both when planning and immediately before mutation.
The service orders ownership admission、generation activation、exact policy load、stable plan、activation revalidation、
planner authority revalidation、F3 trim and final ownership exactly, and never calls `StreamStorage.trim` or waits for
physical deletion. Nine focused tests cover policy/unit/config bounds、strict expiry、stale source and pending-state
vetoes、head/policy/owner drift、exact call order、no-op and ownership loss after durable trim. Pulsar policy/admin
mapping、production runtime installation、shared queue/concurrency enforcement and physical GC remain outside this
checkpoint. The gate passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 against locked Pulsar
`master@bce3422a94edf01c483c15063c6879254b3ff03f`.

Checkpoint AH implements the next production boundary. `NereusRetentionExecutionLane` holds a fixed concurrency slot
until the returned async service operation completes, bounds queued streams, coalesces one admitted operation per
stream, mirrors independent caller completions, applies a whole-operation timeout and drains/fails admitted work on
close. `NereusRetentionRuntime` owns that lane and constructs the exact AG service for each writable ledger；
`NereusManagedLedgerRuntime` closes it before cursor/generation resources, and `NereusManagedLedger` installs the
service and routes `trimConsumedLedgersInBackground` through it. The Pulsar fork maps page/concurrency/queue/operation/
close values with defaults `512 / 4 / 1024 / 60s / 120s`; product-neutral defaults remain
`128 / 8 / 1024 / 30s / 30s`. The exact effective `RetentionPolicies` snapshot and admin admission are deliberately
still absent, so the route fails closed and no physical-delete capability is enabled.
`phase4M5RetentionRuntimeCheck` passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21 against locked Pulsar
`master@68093ba53388c4cdbe6516a35391451646820c71` (151 tasks), including all inherited gates、module checks、contract/
documentation audits and the focused Pulsar formatting/style/test chain.

Checkpoint AI implements the exact broker policy/admin boundary. The resolver stores defensive copies of the exact
effective retention tuple and both typed backlog quotas instead of booleans, carries precise-time mode separately and
accepts generation readiness only from the Nereus storage context. `NereusTopicOpenContext` proves that the installed
`RetentionPolicySnapshot` is the checked canonical conversion of those same Pulsar facts. A policy that can mutate
logical history waits for stable all-broker generation readiness, the product-owned registration/marker activation
guard, final ownership revalidation and a fresh equal complete policy-input tuple before it replaces the loaded
snapshot. The loaded admin path consumes that exact snapshot；the unloaded binding path first checks generation
readiness, and `PersistentTopicsBase` repeats the loaded check before invoking the facade. Partitioned trim waits for
all child requests. Size eviction and precise-time eviction are admitted only when generation-ready；ledger-estimate
time eviction remains rejected, and producer hold/exception does not claim delete authority. The mutation path still
ends at F3 logical trim and physical GC remains disabled. `phase4M5RetentionPolicyAdminCheck` composes the inherited
AH gate、Nereus checks、source/document audits and four focused Pulsar suites. It passed on 2026-07-18 under Java 21
against locked Pulsar `master@330eeeb3fa9903ed0123c2a0e261d403c32f0a59` with 153 aggregate tasks；the final broker
invocation passed 129 tasks.

## 8. F4-M6 — Final Acceptance

### 8.1 Required scenarios

The final gate must cover all of the following as named deterministic or real-service test methods：

1. exact ordinary Entry bytes and MessageId across generation-zero -> higher generation switch；
2. exact compressed/batched middle-batch MessageId and properties through fallback；
3. `PREPARED` index never selected at every crash cut；
4. concurrent publication and lost allocation responses produce unique task-attached generations, harmless gaps and
   a deterministic highest winner；
5. checksum/missing higher object quarantines and falls back only inside `COMMITTED`；
6. `TOPIC_COMPACTED` record is invisible to every ordinary resolver/facade path；
7. resolve/pin/read races GC mark before/after lease write and root revalidation；
8. reader process death protects until skew-safe lease expiry；
9. source task protection races GC mark without early delete；
10. task claim expiry/stale worker/output/publish response loss converges；
11. advisory checkpoint loss/ahead-of-truth cannot skip tasks；
12. recovery checkpoint replaces a live commit prefix and append continues from its bridge；
13. replay/read-index repair works after old commit/gen-0 index/source deletion；
14. checkpoint/root CAS loss and merge leave only safe orphans；
15. multi-stream WAL object remains while any stream slice is live；
16. higher replacement quarantine during source retirement vetoes delete；
17. cursor `PROTECTION_PENDING` at inventory/mark/drain vetoes delete；
18. cursor `TRIM_PENDING` at inventory/mark/drain vetoes delete；
19. owner takeover/root version change invalidates snapshot GC；
20. live/current、old、CAS-lost and deleted-cursor snapshots classify/delete correctly at 10,000 roots；
21. logical trim completes before physical GC and no admin promise waits for object deletion；
22. retention size/time OR formula, zero/infinite and stale publish-time stats；
23. size/precise-time backlog eviction persists cursor then permits safe trim；
24. non-precise ledger time eviction remains rejected；
25. Object-WAL async success before gen-0 index, crash/restart and bounded read repair；
26. materialization lag throttle/reject happens before new primary IO while recovery continues；
27. generation capability two-snapshot barrier and monotonic topic marker；
28. old F3 decoder fails an activated topic before returning a ledger；
29. publication enabled/deletion disabled rollout stage preserves all sources；
30. loaded/unloaded/partitioned admin matrices match；
31. compaction/offload/truncate/read-compacted remain rejected；
32. unload、broker failover and full process restart preserve projection/cursor/generation behavior；
33. same-name topic recreate cannot alias old generation/task/snapshot/object；
34. future catalog sentinel blocks GC when a domain capability is unknown；
35. object listing loss/staleness changes discovery only, never deletion correctness；
36. close/executor rejection completes all callbacks once and leaves recoverable durable work；
37. stock BookKeeper topic remains functional beside Nereus F4 topics；
38. candidate/task/root/lease/protection/domain-snapshot hard limits fail closed with no truncation；
39. no generation/task/object identity leaks into Pulsar Position/MessageId；
40. live projection marker/deleted-incarnation proofs gate single- and multi-stream source/orphan deletion；
41. streaming upload stays within staging/heap bounds and cleans cancellation/crash leftovers；
42. Phase 1/1.5/2/3 final gates remain green；
43. every registry shard/page is scanned fairly and stale hint/watch loss cannot skip authoritative head/task work；
44. an unloaded stream with committed head but no task is rediscovered after all original brokers/process state die；
45. projection ref resolves the current same-incarnation record after mutable property CAS, while missing/mismatched
    registration and marker ordering fail closed at every response-loss cut；
46. deleted-stream registration remains until task/index/recovery/domain drain, then conditional retirement survives
    response loss without affecting a same-name new incarnation；
47. all 256 physical-root shards recover MARKED/DELETING work after process loss, including object-delete success with
    lost response and an empty object-store listing；
48. terminal task/index/stats/checkpoint/sequence/recovery metadata retires only after exact grace/reference proofs,
    and deleted-stream registration is the final conditional key removed；
49. cold unloaded-topic registration backfill covers existing partitions under one stable broker-readiness epoch,
    while concurrent creates self-register and any failure/old-broker join blocks activation；
50. live generation-zero/cursor references receive physical roots/protections before deletion activation, while
    listing omission cannot falsely complete the coverage bit；
51. after the backfill epoch, sync/async append prepare cannot make a head reachable before `REACHABLE_APPEND`, strict
    success cannot precede generation-zero `VISIBLE_GENERATION`, and an abandoned protected intent is reclaimed only
    by the full orphan/head/recovery-domain proof；
52. DELETED-root retirement requires two separated exact HEAD-absence observations, unchanged owner/domain proofs and
    versioned reference/manifest cleanup；a first or retried PUT at every cut is rejected or uses a fresh key, and
    externally reappearing bytes return to the ownerless-orphan proof path。

### 8.2 Scale fixtures

At minimum：

```text
10,000 durable cursor roots for one stream
4,096 generation candidates at admitted edge; 4,097 exact failure
1,000 paginated physical protections/readers
1,001 physical roots in one shard plus at least one root in every other physical shard
10,000 DELETED roots with Phase 1 manifest/reference audit records aged through bounded tombstone retirement
128 source ranges and 1,048,576 offsets in one task
1,000,000 recovery checkpoint commit entries using generated streaming fixture
32 active checkpoint refs followed by merge
16,448 registered streams arranged as 257 entries in each of 64 shards
two brokers + at least two worker runtimes contending on the same streams
```

The million-entry checkpoint test may use generated streaming bytes rather than holding all entries in heap；it must
exercise writer/reader/directory bounds. The registry fixture uses deterministic valid `StreamId` inputs selected by
the frozen shard function；it traverses at least two pages per shard and then restarts with empty continuations.

### 8.3 Gates

```text
./gradlew phase4M6Check
./gradlew phase4M6FinalCheck --rerun-tasks
./gradlew phase4Check
./gradlew phase4FinalCheck --rerun-tasks
```

`phase4FinalCheck` composes every M1-M6 final gate plus `phase3FinalCheck`. It is the only Phase 4 completion claim.

## 9. Gradle / Build Plan

Root changes during implementation：

- `settings.gradle.kts` includes `nereus-materialization` and treats `phase4*`/affected modules as requiring the local
  Pulsar source composite where broker/facade tests need it；
- `nereus-bom` constrains the new artifact；
- through M1 the Phase 4 gate deliberately reuses the fork's frozen `0.1.0-f2-dev` source-composite coordinate so the
  already-final-gated F3 broker tests remain reproducible. F4-M5 changes Nereus and the local Pulsar version catalog
  atomically to the explicit F4 development coordinate before any broker-side F4 code is compiled；neither coordinate
  is treated as a published Pulsar snapshot；
- `gradle/libs.versions.toml` pins Parquet/ZSTD dependencies；
- each integration source set has its own task and Docker requirement；ordinary unit gates stay usable without Docker；
- root M1-M6 tasks depend only on the code/tests available by that milestone；
- final gates use `--rerun-tasks` evidence and do not pass from stale test outputs。

Implemented M1 scripts：

```text
scripts/check-phase4-contract-surface.sh
scripts/check-phase4-documentation.sh
scripts/check-phase4-module-boundaries.sh
scripts/check-phase4-pulsar-source-lock.sh
scripts/check-phase4-guarded-object-put.sh
```

Later-milestone scripts：

```text
scripts/check-phase4-no-direct-trim.sh
scripts/check-phase4-view-isolation.sh
```

Audits fail on missing planned production/test artifacts once their milestone status becomes complete, stale source
locks, broken Markdown links, direct F4 `StreamStorage.trim`, Pulsar imports in protocol-neutral modules and ordinary
resolver references to the topic-compacted namespace. The guarded-PUT audit also rejects unguarded Object WAL,
compacted, checkpoint or cursor-snapshot writes once their F4 publication hook is active.

## 10. Requirement-to-Evidence Matrix

| Requirement | Primary evidence when implemented |
| --- | --- |
| publication only switches physical target | generation publication/failure tests + head unchanged assertion |
| exact Pulsar bytes/MessageIds | Parquet opaque round trip + real two-broker M6 method |
| view separation | keyspace/codec/resolver isolation tests and source audit |
| task not visibility owner | PREPARED/task/index model tests |
| restart-safe stream work discovery | cold-topic coverage gate + registry shard/page/watch-loss tests + unloaded no-task fresh-process gate |
| registry not correctness owner | stale/mismatched hint negative tests + authoritative projection/head reload |
| registry cardinality retirement | full deleted-stream drain proof + same-name recreation/conditional-delete tests |
| unique deterministic generation order | allocator concurrency + resolver property tests |
| safe fallback | quarantine/fallback tests with retained lower target |
| durable reader fence | handshake model + real process-death lease gate |
| task/reference fence | protection model + mark race gate |
| source deletion needs recovery checkpoint | GC negative gate before root + replay positive gate after deletion |
| bounded Oxia/history cardinality | checkpoint/pruning + 10,000-root tombstone-retirement scale fixtures |
| F3 pending lifecycle honored | cursor snapshot/data GC race methods |
| policy trim uses owner coordinator | no-direct-trim audit + ownership-cut tests |
| cursor snapshot inventory not delete authority | final version/domain revalidation tests |
| async ack/read repair | async crash/restart real gate |
| lag cannot discard acknowledged primary | backpressure/recovery tests |
| rollout/downgrade fail closed | capability/marker/old-decoder broker tests |
| future domains extend safely | sentinel/domain registry test |
| object list is audit only | stale/empty list model tests |
| GC lifecycle restart discovery | authoritative 256-shard root scan + empty-list DELETING recovery |
| bounded DELETED-root audit without resurrection | tombstone-retirement scale/race tests + guarded-PUT source audit |
| BookKeeper non-claim/coexistence | profile rejection + stock BK real topic |

## 11. Documentation Synchronization

Every implementation milestone updates：

- this README/milestone status and exact source locks；
- the affected numbered code-level documents from planned surface to actual surface；
- `docs/design/nereus-future4-compaction-generation.md`；
- `docs/design/nereus-commit-protocol.md` for publication/checkpoint/GC facts；
- `docs/design/nereus-storage-object-format.md` for implemented object/golden format；
- `docs/design/nereus-overall-architecture.md` module/status/open decisions；
- `docs/design/nereus-futures.md` and design index delivery status；
- `docs/design/nereus-terminology.md` for new stable terms；
- `docs/automq-like-stream-storage/README.md` when async profile state changes；
- Phase 3 F4 handoff text only when the consumed interface/behavior actually changes。

Designed examples must not be rewritten as implemented until the corresponding executable gate passes. Historical
source hashes remain labeled historical rather than silently replaced.

## 12. Mandatory Review Stops

Stop implementation and reopen the narrow design gate if any of these becomes necessary：

- change `streamId + offset` or Pulsar virtual ledger/entry/batch mapping；
- reconstruct rather than preserve `PULSAR_ENTRY_V1` bytes in `COMMITTED`；
- publish from task/checkpoint/object existence instead of index CAS；
- require multi-key Oxia atomicity；
- delete source before a recovery checkpoint replaces commit/index repair evidence；
- rely on JVM reader counts or object listing for deletion safety；
- send an F4 object PUT/retry without owner/root guard, reuse a deleted object key, or retire a DELETED root without
  the durable dual absence/authority proof；
- bypass current F3 owner/pending protocol or make GC claim cursor ownership；
- expose `TOPIC_COMPACTED` to ordinary ManagedLedger reads；
- enable a BookKeeper profile without a real writer/reader/retention adapter；
- admit Pulsar compaction/read-compacted/offload/truncate in F4；
- add a future reference domain without capability/GC registration。

Tuning worker counts、file sizes within hard bounds、scan intervals or metrics names does not require a protocol review
but still requires config/tests/docs synchronization.

## 13. Phase 4 Exit Gate

Phase 4 may be labeled `Implemented / final-gated` only after：

- M1-M6 gates and aggregate final gate are green；
- Nereus and Pulsar exact worktrees/commits are recorded and clean；
- every scenario in section 8 maps to an executable test method；
- production and test artifact audits find no missing planned surface；
- no stale “Designed” claim remains for implemented F4 behavior and no future/BookKeeper behavior is overclaimed；
- all prior phase final gates pass in the aggregate run；
- physical delete has been proved on real Oxia/S3 with reader/cursor/task/reference races, not only mocked。
