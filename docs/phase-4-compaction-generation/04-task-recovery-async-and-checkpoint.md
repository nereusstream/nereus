# Task State Machines, Recovery, Async Materialization, and Checkpoints

## 1. Runtime Components

The new module owns the following runtime graph：

```text
MaterializationService
  |- RegisteredMaterializationStreamScanner
  |- MaterializationPlanner
  |- MaterializationTaskStore (GenerationMetadataStore facade)
  |- MaterializationWorkerPool
  |    |- SourceProtectionManager
  |    |- ExactSourceRangeReader
  |    |- TopicCompactionEngine
  |    `- CompactedObjectWriter
  |- GenerationCommitter
  |- TaskRecoveryScanner

  |- MaterializationCheckpointReconciler
  |- TerminalWorkflowMetadataRetirer

  `- PhysicalRootTombstoneRetirementCoordinator
```

`MaterializationService` is process-shared and multi-stream. It has no broker/topic ownership assumption. Duplicate
planners/workers on multiple brokers are expected；deterministic task ids and Oxia CAS converge them.

### 1.1 Implemented F4-M3 orchestration and worker checkpoints

The current implementation includes `MaterializationPolicyFactory`、`DefaultMaterializationPlanner`、
`MaterializationTaskStore`、`MaterializationTaskRecovery`、`TaskRecoveryScanner` and
`RegisteredMaterializationStreamScanner`. Focused tests cover deterministic policy versioning、whole-index overlap
tiling independent of scan order、fixed-point termination、exact-source revalidation before create、different-clock
duplicate create convergence、claim expiry with clock-skew margin、publication re-entry from durable task/output and
all-64-shard registered-stream discovery. `MaterializationWorkerPool`、exact-source IO/protection、checkpoint
reconciliation and `MaterializationService` lifecycle composition were still target code at that checkpoint.

The next checkpoint implements `DefaultExactSourceRangeReader`、`LosslessMaterializationRowPublisher` and
`DefaultMaterializationWorker`. The exact reader is stream-scoped, refuses generation substitution, acquires a
durable read pin before IO, revalidates the frozen index/root/format/schema/projection/object identity and enforces
dense offsets while producing exact payload/accounting digests. The row publisher keeps at most one exact source
and one requested page active, maps one source offset to one compacted row without parsing or re-encoding payloads,
and propagates cancellation to the active source.

The worker now performs deterministic claim/response-loss reload, periodic same-claim heartbeat, source protection
acquisition, real Parquet staging, guarded if-absent upload, exact HEAD/full-output verification, output protection
acquisition and the `CLAIMED -> OUTPUT_READY` CAS. Typed failure classes drive durable `RETRY_WAIT`、`CANCELLED` or
`TERMINAL_FAILED` transitions without parsing exception text. Focused tests cover exact multi-page reads and pin
cleanup, missing-frozen-index rejection, real Parquet/local-object-store success and retryable writer failure.

The following checkpoint closes the source/output protection owner gap. `ObjectProtectionManager.acquireOrTransfer`
may create or monotonically converge an existing protection only when its complete protection identity and logical
owner key are unchanged；it rejects owner-version rollback and unrelated-owner takeover and recovers an exact lost CAS
response. `DefaultMaterializationTaskProtectionReconciler` reconstructs deterministic source/output reference ids and
physical identities from an exact durable task, revalidates every source and task after the no-gap handshake, and is
invoked only while the task is `CLAIMED`、`OUTPUT_READY` or `PUBLISHING`, before the committed index becomes the
durable visibility owner. Duplicate expired-claim scanners reload and converge after one CAS wins. Once a task is
`PUBLISHED`, recovery never recreates temporary task-owned protections；the terminal retirer instead proves the
committed index/checkpoint/root/visible-protection facts before releasing them. Focused tests cover
`OUTPUT_READY -> PUBLISHING(attached generation)` owner repair, stale rollback rejection, idempotent replay,
publication ordering and `PUBLISHED` re-entry without temporary-protection recreation.

The fifth checkpoint implements `MaterializationConfig`、`DefaultMaterializationCheckpointReconciler`、the bounded
`DefaultMaterializationTaskDispatcher` and `DefaultMaterializationService`. Configuration now validates the complete
cross-field worker/claim/staging/lag/grace/checkpoint envelope. The checkpoint reconciler performs a bounded full
authoritative index scan from trim, accepts only current-policy/current-projection `COMMITTED` NCP1 generations,
stops at the first gap or unhealthy/wrong-policy range, revalidates activation before create/CAS and reloads the exact
durable replacement after a lost CAS response. An ahead checkpoint fails closed and is never used to hide planner
work. The dispatcher coalesces duplicate local task ids, enforces both global and per-stream active limits, skips a
saturated stream without blocking other streams and rejects/cancels queued work during close. The service runs
non-overlapping 64-shard full passes, coalesces hints into one immediate following pass, keeps injected stores and
executors borrowed, and drains or locally cancels admitted work by `closeTimeout`. Focused tests cover all of these
cuts, including a hung scan、deadline-forced cancellation and borrowed-executor ownership.

This is still not the production materialization gate. The Pulsar Entry/NCP1 opaque-byte round trip now passes. The
protocol-neutral topic-compaction decoder/strategy SPI、exact frozen-identity registry、COMMITTED-source bootstrap、
shared-budget sorted-spill two-pass engine and NTC1 worker/publication path are implemented. The proof-driven terminal
workflow-metadata retirer is also wired after checkpoint reconciliation. `phase4M3Check` and the real Oxia/LocalStack
`phase4M3FinalCheck --rerun-tasks` passed on 2026-07-15；higher-generation production activation remains disabled
until the M4–M6 recovery/GC、async/Pulsar and compatibility gates complete.

F4-M4 checkpoint A now implements the NRC1 values、spill-backed one-at-a-time codec、strict bounded open/lookup path
and `MetadataRecoveryCheckpointVerifier`. It proves canonical recovery bytes can be built and consumed without an
object-store -> metadata dependency. The runtime graph's `RecoveryCheckpointCoordinator`、root CAS/protection manager、
anchor-aware consumers and retirement/GC nodes below remain target code；the object codec alone does not shorten the
live commit tail or release any source protection.

F4-M4 checkpoint B implements the section 9 generation-zero entry sequence for the currently executable strict
Object-WAL profile. `AppendCoordinator` prepares an exact immutable intent, establishes the physical root and
commit-owned `REACHABLE_APPEND`, submits the protected head CAS, materializes the exact generation-zero index and then
establishes index-owned `VISIBLE_GENERATION` before success. `recoverAppend` runs the same idempotent sequence, so a
lost head or index response cannot return an unprotected result. Production assembly uses the shared Oxia runtime for
the separate L0 and physical adapters and drains storage before closing protection resources. This checkpoint does
not yet build/publish NRC1 roots or retire the live tail；those runtime graph nodes remain target code.

F4-M4 checkpoint C foundation now implements the exact metadata/core boundary used by the coordinator. Production
and fake metadata stores expose a bounded newest-to-oldest append-recovery tail whose cursor is bound to the observed
head and recovery-root anchor；legacy commits are converted to the same metadata-version-zero generic envelope written
to NRC1. `AnchorAwareCommitWalker` repeats its bounded walk when the root changes. `RecoveryCheckpointBuilder` then
selects only a grace-old, whole-commit, gap-free prefix covered by exact lossless `COMMITTED` generations, enforces a
4,096 all-candidate scan bound, constructs canonical entries/publications, and can revalidate every selected durable
fact before publication. `RecoveryCheckpointProtectionManager` defines root-owned pending/permanent handshakes and
revalidates exact target key/id/kind/range. The guarded object upload、full NRC1 verification、root CAS、post-CAS
reconciliation and pending-to-permanent orchestration remain in `RecoveryCheckpointCoordinator` target code；this
foundation does not retire metadata or authorize deletion.

F4-M4 checkpoint D now implements the guarded publication sequence in §8.3 through permanent-protection
reconciliation. `RecoveryCheckpointCoordinator` uses one operation deadline, revalidates activation and the exact
builder plan before every provider attempt and publication mutation, treats only the recovery-root CAS as visibility,
and resolves a lost CAS response only by reloading the exact desired root. `RecoveryCheckpointRootReconciler` then
opens every current-root NRC1 reference, pages its publication table without aggregating it in heap, reloads each
exact `COMMITTED` generation index/ACTIVE target root, establishes current-root-owned object/target protections, and
only then removes the deterministic pending protection. The same reconciler runs before the next build, so a process
death immediately after root CAS converges after restart. Raw embedded generation-record SHA and the durable Oxia
envelope SHA are deliberately separate facts and are both verified. Focused tests cover lost root-CAS response and
post-CAS/pre-permanent process death. Checkpoint-aware replay/index repair and all retirement/GC work remain target
code；root publication alone still authorizes no deletion.

F4-M4 checkpoint E implements the append-replay half of §8.5. `RecoveryCheckpointCodecV1` now locates the unique
commit entry covering an offset using one bounded sparse-directory block. `CheckpointAppendReplayReader` performs
root-stable live-tail search、current-root reference selection、durable read-pin admission、strict NRC1 lookup and a
final exact root reload, restarting the whole proof when the root changes. Live and checkpoint records share
`AppendReplayRecords` validation；the coordinator distinguishes the evidence source so checkpoint replay never
recreates a retired historical primary target. `DefaultStreamStorage` exposes the explicit injection seam while its
legacy constructors remain live-only. Focused tests cover missing live commit keys、root change during pin、ID
non-aliasing and lease cleanup. Checkpoint-derived index repair、runtime enablement、retirement and GC remain target
code, so checkpoint E authorizes no deletion.

F4-M4 checkpoint F implements the index-repair half of §8.5. `CheckpointDerivedIndexRepairer` routes a target using
the root-stable live-tail walk；live coverage retains the existing bounded metadata repair, while checkpoint coverage
pins/opens NRC1 and reads only the publication indexes named by the covering commit. It chooses the highest exact
COMMITTED candidate whose physical root is ACTIVE, establishes current-root-owned target protection, revalidates
`GENERATION_PUBLISH` activation/root/trim/physical identity/protection, and calls the exact committed-index
put-if-absent restore contract. Raw NRC1 record SHA and durable Oxia envelope SHA remain separate. Root change restarts
the complete proof and trim performs no write. The resolver then fresh-scans authority rather than trusting the
repair result as a read answer. Runtime composition、retirement and GC remain target code；checkpoint F authorizes no
deletion.

F4-M4 checkpoint G implements the metadata mutation boundary required by the future retirement/GC nodes in the
runtime graph. The source adapter captures the otherwise-private committed-marker version/digest and conditionally
deletes exact legacy/generic generation-zero index、marker and checkpoint-replaced commit records. The object-audit
adapter reads hydrated Phase 1 reference/manifest records while preserving their stored-envelope digest and permits
only exact conditional delete. Both adapters borrow a get/delete-only view of the shared Oxia runtime and fail closed
on absence or response uncertainty. No runtime node invokes them yet：the future coordinator must first establish and
revalidate the recovery-root、generation、activation、reference-domain and physical-root lifecycle proof from document
05, so checkpoint G still authorizes no physical deletion.

F4-M4 checkpoint H implements the process-local inputs for the future GC nodes without instantiating those nodes.
`PhysicalGcConfig` is cross-validated with materialization/storage lifetimes and defaults to observation-only；
`GcCandidate` freezes one exact ACTIVE root/query/evidence tuple or the current MARKED wrapper during restart；the
restart form does not assume the prior Oxia version is adjacent. `GcPlan` commits complete non-veto domain facts、
full versioned protection owner/value facts and typed metadata key/version/envelope facts into a canonical digest,
then binds that digest to the exact successful MARK wrapper. The
plan has deliberately no durable codec. Crash recovery must rerun discovery and obtain the same digest from
authoritative metadata before drain or deletion can continue. Reference-domain implementations、root transitions and
all metadata/object delete calls are still absent from runtime composition.

F4-M4 checkpoint I implements the bounded generic aggregation and root-fence nodes but still does not instantiate the
target runtime graph. `GcReferenceDomainRegistry` freezes one canonical unique local `(domainId, protocolVersion)` set,
collects snapshots sequentially under the collector's one operation deadline and distinguishes veto、incomplete and
configured-limit blockers. Its drain revalidation requires the exact same complete set and calls each domain's
`stillMatches` in order. `PhysicalObjectGarbageCollector` additionally requires
`projection-generation-v1@1`、an injected `GcPlanMetadataRevalidator` and the existing physical metadata/activation
contracts. It can recoverably execute `ACTIVE -> MARKED`, wait through drain grace and every reader lease's skew-safe
expiry, unmark on domain/protection/metadata drift, and execute only the durable `MARKED -> DELETING` intent. It has no
reference to the retirement adapters or object-store delete API, so a later composition checkpoint must provide one
coordinator for DELETING recovery and destructive work rather than treating this fence as completion.

`PhysicalObjectRootScanner` now provides the restart discovery side of that graph: each pass scans all 256 metadata
shards with bounded sequential pages/visitor calls, validates key progression and reports exact lifecycle counts.
Overlapping passes and post-close admission fail；the injected metadata store and scheduler remain borrowed. At
checkpoint I, production runtime composition、concrete reference-domain implementations and all DELETING side effects
were still target code；checkpoint J below implements the first three domains without composing them.

F4-M4 checkpoint J now implements the affected-stream storage domains that can be constructed from existing runtime
dependencies: `GenerationReferenceDomain`、`AppendRecoveryReferenceDomain` and
`MaterializationReferenceDomain`. They are not process-local adapters：the SPI now passes the exact query back to
`stillMatches`, and each revalidation repeats its complete bounded authoritative scan. Generation scans both views and
admits a higher-generation removal only after `DRAINING`; append recovery binds optional root/head/live-tail facts and
vetoes any currently required checkpoint/source；materialization vetoes matching nonterminal task source/output facts.
Every emitted removable reference must be covered by an exact plan removal tuple before MARK digest construction.

These domains deliberately fail ownerless queries as incomplete/veto because the registration scanner is a liveness
hint, not cluster-wide absence truth. At checkpoint J, projection/cursor/future-sentinel domains and the global
backfill epoch remained required before ownerless GC. The new classes were not installed in
`MaterializationRuntime`; checkpoint J changed no production activation or deletion behavior.

Checkpoint T later adds the activation/backfill/domain-set-gated global scope and reuses these same exact scans for
ownerless queries. It still does not install them in `MaterializationRuntime` or enable production deletion.

Checkpoint U adds the standalone `DefaultPhysicalRootTombstoneRetirementCoordinator`. It consumes those ownerless
domain proofs plus reader/protection absence, persists the separated HEAD-absence window and retires Phase 1 audits
root-last. At checkpoint U the class was not scheduled or installed by `MaterializationRuntime`；checkpoint AN now
installs it behind the metadata-first physical-GC lifecycle router without changing the delete-activation boundary.

F4-M4 checkpoint K adds the two affected-stream managed-ledger domains without changing that runtime boundary.
`ProjectionGenerationReferenceDomain` reads the exact per-stream F2 binding and the current topic authority selected
by that binding；missing derived binding/topic、same-incarnation `DELETING`, or a live same-incarnation topic without
generation marker 1 vetoes. `DELETED` clears the same-incarnation compatibility proof, while a replacement clears an
old stream only when both incarnation and storage-class binding generation strictly increase. The topic-published /
binding-repair-missing crash cut therefore cannot authorize deletion.

`CursorSnapshotReferenceDomain` reads the exact F3 retention record and completely pages cursor roots. Pending
retention lifecycle、retention/cursor projection mismatch、or an ACTIVE root pointing to the candidate object vetoes；
the last case also emits an owner-bound reference. Both domains use the core bounded canonical snapshot builder,
rerun the full query in `stillMatches`, and at checkpoint K returned incomplete+veto for ownerless queries. Checkpoint
T later supplies the gated global scope；production runtime installation and cursor snapshot GC remain later work.

Checkpoint AJ implements the cursor-snapshot GC discovery/revalidation node without moving deletion ownership into
managed-ledger. `CursorSnapshotGcScanner` uses one bounded asynchronous pass to load the exact F3 retention authority、
page every cursor root、page the canonical snapshot prefix and page every candidate protection. It accepts no
truncation beyond 10,000 values, validates the strict NCS key inverse、age/skew、ACTIVE physical-root/list identity and
only owner-bound cursor protections. It emits a canonical `CURSOR_SNAPSHOT_CANDIDATE` query to one visitor at a time
but performs no root/protection/object mutation.

The central `PhysicalObjectGarbageCollector` now accepts a candidate-kind-specific final revalidator. It invokes that
callback only after the second reader/protection/metadata drain and before the final MARKED root、sealed journal and
activation revalidation. The cursor callback repeats the complete inventory and accepts only unchanged retention/
cursor/list/protection authority plus the exact one-epoch MARKED successor. Ordinary drift unmarks；an incomplete or
failed read leaves MARKED for restart-safe retry.

Checkpoint AK closes the restart cut after MARK. Candidate evidence now excludes discovery time and the transient
ACTIVE metadata wrapper；it binds a normalized ACTIVE owner epoch plus immutable object/list/authority/protection
facts. `recoverMarked` repeats the complete inventory against the exact one-epoch MARKED successor and reconstructs
the same query when those facts are unchanged. Complete fact drift produces another digest and
`unmarkDrifted` conditionally restores only that exact MARKED root to ACTIVE；incomplete/backend/limit failure leaves
MARKED for later retry.

`CursorSnapshotGcExecutor` translates the scanner's protections into the canonical plan and is the only adapter for
`mark -> drain/final revalidation -> DELETING -> SourceRetirementCoordinator.resume`. It can independently recover an
exact MARKED or DELETING root after restart. `Phase4PhysicalGcRuntime` composes that adapter with the durable journal、
all six reference domains and the complete metadata-retirement handler registry, and production managed-ledger
ownership closes this runtime before the cursor and shared stores. Checkpoint AL additionally installs the
provider-owned known-prefix inventory scanner. It can register an old exact-HEAD object whose root is missing, but it
cannot itself mark or delete objects. Checkpoint AM adds the bounded registration-retirement coordinator and exact F3
cursor/retention authority, including published-workflow and non-empty NRC1 owner/protection response-loss tests.

Checkpoint AN installs those primitives as one metadata-first lifecycle. `PhysicalGcLifecyclePass.run()` first awaits
one complete 256-shard `PhysicalObjectRootScanner` pass, then one complete 64-shard
`StreamRegistrationRetirementScanner` pass, and only then invokes `ObjectInventoryScanner`; a failed stage prevents
every later stage from starting. `Phase4PhysicalRootLifecycleRouter` dispatches ACTIVE cursor roots to at most one
complete cursor scan per stream per pass, other ACTIVE roots to `OwnerlessObjectGcExecutor`, MARKED roots to exact
cursor/ownerless recovery, DELETING roots directly to `SourceRetirementCoordinator.resume`, DELETED roots to the
tombstone coordinator and QUARANTINED roots to no-op. The ownerless executor reconstructs its immutable-identity plan
after restart and still delegates the mark/drain/final-proof/delete sequence to `PhysicalObjectGarbageCollector`.

`DefaultPhysicalGcLifecycleService` starts with an immediate pass, forbids overlap, coalesces hints into at most one
additional immediate pass and uses fixed delay measured after completion or failure. Close cancels scheduled work,
waits for the active source and target futures and never closes borrowed executors. The provider calls `start()` only
when `PhysicalGcConfig.enabled()` is true. The current broker bridge still supplies
`PhysicalGcConfig.defaults()` (`enabled=false, dryRun=true`), so startup schedules no pass and performs no physical
deletion；broker knob mapping、coverage/delete activation and final real-service evidence remain target work.

Full M4–M6 target construction：

```java
public final class MaterializationRuntime implements AutoCloseable {
    public MaterializationRuntime(
            String cluster,
            String processRunId,
            StreamStorage streamStorage,
            OxiaMetadataStore l0MetadataStore,
            SourceRetirementMetadataStore sourceRetirementStore,
            ObjectAuditRetirementStore objectAuditRetirementStore,
            GenerationMetadataStore generationStore,
            PhysicalObjectMetadataStore objectMetadataStore,
            ObjectStore objectStore,
            ReadTargetReaderRegistry readers,
            GenerationProtocolActivationGuard activationGuard,
            MaterializationConfig config,
            PhysicalGcConfig physicalGcConfig,
            ScheduledExecutorService scheduler,
            ExecutorService workerExecutor,
            Executor callbackExecutor,
            Clock clock,
            List<GcReferenceDomain> referenceDomains,
            MaterializationMetricsObserver observer) { }
}
```

Every dependency is non-null and borrowed by `MaterializationRuntime`；it closes its admitted internal work but does
not close stores or shut down injected executors. `DefaultNereusRuntimeProvider` is their sole owner and closes them
after this runtime drains, in the order fixed by document 06. Unit tests use deterministic clocks/executors；
production never uses common fork-join pools.

The implemented M3 lifecycle surface is：

```java
public interface MaterializationService extends AutoCloseable {
    CompletableFuture<Void> start();
    CompletableFuture<RegisteredMaterializationScanResult> scanNow();
    CompletableFuture<Void> closeAsync();
    boolean isRunning();
    @Override void close();
}

public final class DefaultMaterializationService implements MaterializationService {
    public DefaultMaterializationService(
            RegisteredMaterializationStreamScanner scanner,
            MaterializationTaskDispatcher dispatcher,
            MaterializationConfig config,
            ScheduledExecutorService scheduler,
            Executor callbackExecutor,
            MaterializationMetricsObserver observer);
}
```

`start` is idempotent only while running and schedules an immediate full pass. `scanNow` requires RUNNING state；an
in-flight call returns the current pass and sets one coalesced immediate rescan. A completed pass schedules the next
fixed-delay pass, including after a failed pass. `closeAsync` is idempotent, first rejects new dispatcher work and
cancels scheduled scans, then waits for the current pass and dispatcher drain. At the configured deadline it cancels
the exposed pass/active local workers and completes close without shutting down the borrowed scheduler/callback/worker
executors. Metrics callbacks are best-effort and can never own or block lifecycle correctness.

`GenerationProtocolActivationGuard` is a protocol-neutral core interface. The managed-ledger implementation proves
cluster readiness and the exact projection marker through product metadata；materialization receives only a typed
`GenerationActivationProof` and never imports or decodes Pulsar records.

## 2. Configuration and Limits

```java
public record MaterializationConfig(
        MaterializationPolicy committedPolicy,
        int registryScanPageSize,
        Duration registryScanInterval,
        int plannerPageSize,
        int taskScanPageSize,
        int maxTasksPerPlan,
        int maxConcurrentWorkers,
        int maxConcurrentWorkersPerStream,
        int sourceReadPageRecords,
        long sourceReadPageBytes,
        Path stagingDirectory,
        long maxStagingBytes,
        int uploadChunkBytes,
        Duration workerClaimDuration,
        Duration workerClaimRenewInterval,
        Duration maximumClockSkew,
        Duration operationTimeout,
        Duration closeTimeout,
        Duration retryMinBackoff,
        Duration retryMaxBackoff,
        int maxTaskAttempts,
        long lagThrottleRecords,
        long lagRejectRecords,
        long lagThrottleBytes,
        long lagRejectBytes,
        Duration lagRejectAge,
        Duration lagThrottleDelay,
        Duration sourceRetirementGrace,
        Duration appendReplayGrace,
        Duration metadataAuditGrace,
        int recoveryCheckpointMaxEntries,
        long recoveryCheckpointMaxBytes) { }
```

Validation：

- committed policy is exactly `COMMITTED + LOSSLESS_REWRITE + NEREUS_COMPACTED_PARQUET_V1` with no topic-compaction
  spec and satisfies document 02 hard limits；
- registry/task/planner page sizes and concurrency are positive and within document 03 hard limits；registry scan
  interval is positive；
- source read pages are positive, records are at most 65,536 and bytes are in `[64 KiB, 64 MiB]`；the byte limit also
  fits the shared core read-buffer reservation and one worker may retain at most one delivered page at a time；
- staging directory is absolute/owner-only，staging bytes cover at least
  `max(committedPolicy.targetObjectBytes(), recoveryCheckpointMaxBytes)` and upload chunks are in
  `[64 KiB, 8 MiB]`；the global staging semaphore is acquired before writing and released exactly once on cleanup；
- renew interval is at most one third of claim duration；
- maximum clock skew is non-negative and millisecond-representable；operation timeout plus maximum clock skew is
  strictly less than claim duration；
- retry backoff is positive and bounded；
- each lag threshold is non-negative and zero disables only that threshold；when throttle and reject are both enabled,
  throttle is strictly below reject；lag throttle delay is positive；
- source-retirement、append-replay and metadata-audit grace are positive；metadata audit grace is not shorter than
  source-retirement grace；
- checkpoint entry/byte limits do not exceed NRC1 hard limits；
- close timeout is positive。

Configuration changes do not alter an existing task. Policy/format inputs are copied into a complete immutable
durable policy snapshot plus its canonical digest. Recovery uses that snapshot rather than rebuilding a policy from
current operator configuration.

## 3. Task Lifecycle

### 3.1 Closed state set

```java
public enum TaskLifecycle {
    PLANNED(1),
    CLAIMED(2),
    OUTPUT_READY(3),
    PUBLISHING(4),
    PUBLISHED(5),
    RETRY_WAIT(6),
    CANCELLED(7),
    TERMINAL_FAILED(8)
}
```

Transitions：

```text
PLANNED      -> CLAIMED
RETRY_WAIT   -> CLAIMED               after retryNotBefore
CLAIMED      -> CLAIMED               same claim heartbeat only
CLAIMED      -> OUTPUT_READY
CLAIMED      -> RETRY_WAIT
CLAIMED      -> CANCELLED
CLAIMED      -> TERMINAL_FAILED
OUTPUT_READY -> PUBLISHING
OUTPUT_READY -> RETRY_WAIT             only before any possibly committed publication
PUBLISHING   -> PUBLISHED
PUBLISHING   -> OUTPUT_READY            only after proving index absent/ABORTED
PUBLISHING   -> RETRY_WAIT              same proof required

PUBLISHED terminal for execution; retained for audit/checkpoint
CANCELLED terminal
TERMINAL_FAILED terminal
```

`attempt` increments only on `PLANNED/RETRY_WAIT -> CLAIMED`. Terminal fields are immutable after the terminal CAS.

### 3.2 Worker claim

```java
public record WorkerClaimRecord(
        String claimId,
        String processRunId,
        long attempt,
        long claimedAtMillis,
        long expiresAtMillis) { }
```

Claim id is a random 128-bit lowercase base32 value and becomes the output-attempt id. A claimant：

1. loads task and checks `PLANNED` or eligible `RETRY_WAIT`；
2. CASes the task to `CLAIMED` with incremented attempt and bounded expiry；
3. creates every source `MATERIALIZATION_SOURCE` protection；
4. revalidates each physical root after protection creation；
5. only then starts source IO；
6. heartbeats by same-key task CAS before the renewal deadline。

A stale claim cannot write output because `claimId + attempt + task metadataVersion` are required at the output CAS.
After expiry, another worker may reclaim. The old worker must treat heartbeat/output CAS conflict as cancellation and
release local buffers/leases；its uploaded immutable object is harmless until referenced.

Clock-based expiry assumes the configured maximum broker clock skew. Reclaim waits until
`expiresAt + maxClockSkew`; this safety margin is shared with reader leases.

### 3.3 Failure classes

```java
public enum TaskFailureClass {
    NONE(0),
    RETRYABLE_METADATA(1),
    RETRYABLE_OBJECT_STORE(2),
    RETRYABLE_RESOURCE_LIMIT(3),
    SOURCE_CHANGED(4),
    SOURCE_RETIRED(5),
    UNSUPPORTED_MAPPING(6),
    OUTPUT_INVARIANT(7),
    CORRUPT_SOURCE(8),
    CLOSED(9)
}
```

- classes 1-3 enter `RETRY_WAIT` with capped exponential jitter；
- 4-5 cancel the task and ask the planner for a fresh source set；
- 6-8 are terminal and emit an operator-visible reason；
- 9 is retryable after process restart unless shutdown explicitly cancelled the task before claim；
- message/cause classes are diagnostic only and do not control this decision。

## 4. Planner Algorithm

### 4.1 Registered-stream discovery

`RegisteredMaterializationStreamScanner` is the process-wide liveness entry point. It keeps one in-memory continuation
per shard, visits shards `00..63` round-robin and invokes
`scanStreamRegistrations(cluster, shard, continuation, registryScanPageSize)`. End-of-shard clears that continuation；
a completed pass starts again at the prefix, and restart starts every shard at the prefix. Watches only schedule an
earlier pass.

For each decoded registration `R` it performs, under one operation deadline：

```text
validate registry key/shard/record identity
load authoritative L0 StreamMetadata
decode R.projectionRef
requireReady(GENERATION_PUBLISH,
    LiveProjectionSubject(streamId, projectionRef, projectionIdentitySha256), false)
require stream is live, profile matches R and generation operation is admitted
scan the exact per-stream task prefix with bounded pagination
reconcile non-terminal tasks/index-without-task-finalization
load head + recovery root + materialization checkpoint
plan any authoritative committed coverage not represented by a valid task/index
revalidate activation proof immediately before every task/checkpoint mutation
```

`lastHintCommitVersion` may prioritize a stream but never skips head、task or index reads. A stale/deleted projection
cannot be made live by the registration；it is skipped and cleanup is delegated to the domain-validated path in
document 05. A missing/mismatched registration blocks broker activation/async admission as described in document 06.
Therefore a committed head is discoverable even when the creating broker died before task creation and no broker owns
or has loaded the topic. Duplicate scanners are harmless because planning ids and task transitions use deterministic
keys/CAS.

`TaskRecoveryScanner` is not a second global enumeration mechanism. It consumes the validated stream discovered above
and pages `scanTasks(cluster, streamId, continuation, taskScanPageSize)` until completion. A task watch may enqueue the
same stream for lower latency but never substitutes for the registry pass.

The implemented scanner visits all 64 shards and every returned page on each complete pass. It validates canonical
registry key/value identity, reloads L0 state/profile/head and effective projection, calls activation `requireReady`,
recovers the stream's durable tasks, plans authoritative `[trim, head)` coverage, and revalidates the captured
activation proof immediately before task mutation. The advisory materialization checkpoint is intentionally not yet
used as a skip boundary；this is slower but prevents a stale/ahead checkpoint from hiding committed work until the
checkpoint repair/reconciler lands.

### 4.2 Candidate discovery

For `(stream, policy)`：

```text
load head/trim and advisory materialization checkpoint
scan requested view index from max(trimOffset, checkpoint hint)
hydrate all healthy visible/admitted whole-index entries within the bounded scan
build a DAG whose vertices are exact index boundaries and whose edges are complete
  non-split source ranges; adjacent edges must also have equal cumulative-size
  boundary and compatible payload/projection/schema facts; generation zero guarantees
  the baseline path
choose one canonical gap-free/non-overlapping path, ranked by:
  furthest end within range/record/byte bounds;
  then fewest source edges;
  then lexicographic edge sequence of generation descending,
       edge end descending, indexKey unsigned-UTF-8 ascending
form canonical contiguous runs from that path with identical:
  payload format
  projection identity
  logical format
  schema compatibility
  read view
stop at policy max source ranges/range records/target bytes
classify a run eligible only when:
  any selected source is generation zero or has a different policy/physical format; OR
  at least policy.minMergeSourceRanges current-policy higher-generation sources can be
    replaced by one output within every range/byte bound
never split/clip an index source and never create a task whose sole source is one
  healthy current-policy higher generation
```

The checkpoint is only a starting hint. The planner verifies actual index coverage and searches backward when a gap or
missing task is found. A checkpoint ahead of truth is repaired and cannot skip work.

Before task create the planner also scans committed indexes for the deterministic source-set/policy/coverage identity.
An already committed result repairs task/checkpoint state；it does not schedule a rewrite. The eligibility rule makes
a stable policy converge to a fixed set of bounded objects instead of generating an unbounded sequence of semantically
identical generations. A policy digest change may intentionally rewrite once, after which the same fixed-point rule
applies.

The planner path need not equal the per-offset read resolver's highest-generation choice：all admitted `COMMITTED`
sources are lossless and byte-identical for overlapping offsets. Requiring whole edges preserves exact index identity、
logical bytes and cumulative boundaries without inventing per-record metadata. If no complete path reaches a safe
task boundary, planning stops conservatively and reports the first gap；it never clips a larger source around an
overlap. Candidate/edge counts remain under the resolver/task hard limits, so the dynamic-programming path table is
bounded.

Fully trimmed ranges are not materialized. A source entry straddling trim remains whole in V1；planner does not invent
a partial generation-zero target. Later higher-generation compaction may align future ranges, but ordinary read still
starts at current trim.

### 4.3 Canonical task create

The planner calculates source/policy digests and deterministic task id from document 02, then `putIfAbsent`：

- absent：create `PLANNED`；
- present byte-for-byte same immutable identity：reuse current lifecycle；
- same key with different immutable fields：metadata invariant failure；
- terminal cancelled because source changed：the new source set produces a different id；
- already published：advance/reconcile checkpoint only。

`taskSequence` equals the final source `lastCommitVersion`; it is a deterministic scheduling key, not a uniqueness or
visibility field.

The first create identity excludes `createdAtMillis`, because independently planning brokers have different clocks.
An existing task with the same deterministic planning identity is reused; after creation its original timestamp and
embedded full policy snapshot are immutable inputs to every later lifecycle CAS.

Task create is allowed before source protections exist. A worker that cannot acquire a protection because GC marked a
source cancels/replans. GC also scans task records as defense-in-depth but correctness relies on explicit protections
and the root handshake, not on catching an instantaneous task-create scan.

### 4.4 Overlap policy

At most one local active task per `(stream, view, policy, overlapping range)` is scheduled, but correctness does not
depend on this local rule. Concurrent brokers may publish overlapping lossless generations. Unique generation numbers
give a deterministic winner；the retirement planner later removes fully dominated targets.

For `TOPIC_COMPACTED`, a task source coverage is immutable and append-only offsets inside that range cannot change.
Strategy id/version is part of task identity, so a later policy is a new generation rather than an in-place semantic
mutation.

In V1 the task/policy `view` is the target namespace, while `taskKind.sourceView()` is `COMMITTED` for both lossless
and topic tasks. The topic planner therefore performs two bounded scans：COMMITTED candidates form the exact source
DAG, while TOPIC_COMPACTED candidates only suppress an exact already-published current-policy result. Sparse NTC1
rows are never reused as a dense exact source. This also makes equal numeric generation values in the two independent
view counters harmless because the complete source/index identity always includes the view.

## 5. Worker Algorithm

### 5.1 Exact source reader

The worker must not call ordinary `StreamStorage.read` and accidentally consume a newer target than the task snapshot.
It uses：

```java
public interface ExactSourceRangeReader {
    CompletableFuture<ExactSourceRead> read(
            SourceGeneration expected,
            ReadOptions options);
}

public interface ExactSourceRead extends AutoCloseable {
    SourceGeneration source();
    Flow.Publisher<ReadBatch> batches();
    CompletableFuture<ExactSourceReadSummary> completion();
    @Override void close();
}

public record ExactSourceReadSummary(
        OffsetRange coverage,
        int recordCount,
        int entryCount,
        long logicalBytes,
        Checksum orderedPayloadSha256) { }
```

The implementation acquires a durable lease for `expected.readTarget`, re-reads the exact index key/version/identity，
and dispatches that exact target. If it changed/disappeared, the read fails `SOURCE_CHANGED`; it never silently
substitutes another generation while continuing to claim the old source digest.

The publisher is cold and single-subscription. It pages the selected target using
`sourceReadPageRecords/sourceReadPageBytes`, emits immutable `ReadBatch` values only under demand and holds the exact
object lease until terminal completion or `close`. At most one emitted page may be outstanding；cancel/decoder error
closes the current reader future and releases the lease exactly once. `completion` succeeds only after dense ordered
coverage and all counts/bytes/digest match the source snapshot. The worker consumes sources sequentially, so task
memory is bounded independently of its 1 GiB object limit.

### 5.2 Lossless rewrite

```text
for each canonical source:
  acquire exact source lease and revalidate protection/root/index
  read within task deadline/resource budget
  verify offset/count/payload/projection/checksums
  append rows in strictly increasing offset order

verify final dense coverage and logical/cumulative totals
stream into bounded private staging file under the global byte permit
finalize/seal Parquet footer and calculate content SHA-256 + storage CRC32C
derive generation-neutral key/object id from content SHA-256 + durable worker claim/outputAttemptId
reread exact CLAIMED task/claim/version and optional physical root;
  require the root absent or the same ACTIVE identity
put if absent through ReplayableObjectUpload without whole-object heap aggregation;
  its PutObjectAttemptGuard repeats that task/claim/root proof before every provider transmission
HEAD and strict-read the footer + sampled/all payload according to gate
create/register physical root if absent
create MATERIALIZATION_OUTPUT protection and revalidate root
CAS CLAIMED -> OUTPUT_READY with exact output
release read leases; keep source/output durable protections
close/delete staging file and release its byte permit on every completion/cancel path
```

The production publish gate performs a complete logical scan of the new object's offset/CRC columns. Tests and final
acceptance perform byte-for-byte full comparison. Sampling alone cannot publish.

For `PULSAR_ENTRY_V1`, every source `ReadBatch` must contain one exact Entry per offset. Any normalization, missing
batch boundary or Entry parse/re-encode attempt is `OUTPUT_INVARIANT`.

### 5.3 Topic-compaction worker

`DefaultMaterializationWorker` accepts optional `TopicCompactionEngine` + `TopicCompactionRegistry` composition.
Legacy/lossless constructors leave topic execution disabled；a TOPIC task is admitted only when its target view、
physical format、strategy snapshot and configured engine all agree. The worker resolves the exact durable binding and
passes the task's immutable `createdAtMillis` to `prepare` as the one tombstone planning time.

`DefaultTopicCompactionEngine` performs this bounded deterministic protocol：

1. pass one reads only the exact frozen COMMITTED sources, one dense record per offset, and requires decoder output
   to repeat the supplied offset；empty decoder output marks that offset as unkeyed retain-exact；
2. keyed facts retain the latest offset per key. The in-memory key budget is configurable in `[64 KiB, 256 MiB]`；
   keys are capped at `1 MiB - 1`, task records at 1,048,576, and sorted merge fan-in at `[2, 64]`；
3. full immutable key-sorted runs spill through `StagingFileManager.createSpill`, sharing the same process-wide byte
   budget as product staging files. Each run is owner-only、fsynced、file-identity sealed and SHA-256 verified while
   merging；
4. the merge produces a bounded survivor `BitSet`, output count and canonical digest over all decoder/strategy facts.
   Spill files are closed and their byte reservations released before the plan is returned；
5. pass two reopens the same exact sources, recomputes every fact/digest and emits survivors in source-offset order.
   VALUE carries the original exact payload；TOMBSTONE carries no payload；
6. the row publisher writes collision-free NTC1 keys as `0x00 || decoder-key` or
   `0x01 || int64-big-endian-offset`. Writer/strict reader require
   `nereus.compaction.key.encoding=TAGGED_V1` and validate the unkeyed embedded offset；
7. any source/decoder mutation、digest/count mismatch、spill corruption、oversized key、cancellation or incomplete
   replay fails before upload/publication. The plan is close-owned and single-subscription.

After engine preparation, the worker reuses the lossless path's claim、source protections、heartbeat、guarded
if-absent upload、HEAD/full-format verification、physical-root/output protection and `CLAIMED -> OUTPUT_READY` CAS.
The resulting `MaterializationOutput` keeps dense `sourceRecordCount` and sparse `outputRecordCount`. Publication uses
`TOPIC_COMPACTED_PUBLISH` and only the TOPIC_COMPACTED index namespace；ordinary COMMITTED resolve/fallback cannot see
it. Focused tests cover forced spill、latest-key/unkeyed/tombstone behavior、decoder drift、budget release、real Parquet
NTC1 output and view-isolated generation publication.

This primitive is tested in F4 but is not scheduled from Pulsar compaction policy until F8.

## 6. Publish Recovery

### 6.1 `OUTPUT_READY -> PUBLISHING`

The first CAS freezes：

- publication id；
- exact output identity；
- source/policy digests；
- publishing start time。

The task initially enters `PUBLISHING(publicationId, allocatedGeneration=empty)`. The owner then allocates G and
CASes the exact pair into the same task before creating an index. If the allocation response is lost and another
stream/view allocation interleaves, a retry may burn a second G for the same publication id；only the G that wins the
task CAS can ever be used by `createPrepared`. Once the task contains G, recovery never calls the allocator again and
never allocates a replacement until the exact index outcome is proved absent/`ABORTED`.

The candidate CAS generates one random 128-bit lowercase-base32 publication id. Response loss does not regenerate it：
recovery reloads the task and uses the stored value. A later, proved-aborted transition back to `OUTPUT_READY` clears
both publication id and generation；only the next distinct publish attempt then generates a new id.

### 6.2 Reconcile algorithm

```text
load task T
if T is OUTPUT_READY:
  CAS -> PUBLISHING(new stable publication id, no G)
if T is PUBLISHING with no G:
  allocate; CAS one returned G into T; every losing/unattached G is a permanent gap

load exact index key K(view, end, G)
if K absent:
  require no committed result for publication id
  create PREPARED and continue normal publish
if K PREPARED same identity:
  verify all preconditions; COMMIT or ABORT
if K COMMITTED same identity:
  CAS-transfer visible protection owner task -> exact K; CAS task -> PUBLISHED
if K ABORTED same identity:
  prove no committed K, conditionally remove task-owned visible protection,
  CAS task -> OUTPUT_READY/RETRY_WAIT clearing publication/G;
  allocate a new publication id/G only afterward
if K QUARANTINED/DRAINING/RETIRED same identity:
  task is historically PUBLISHED; record terminal publication health separately
else:
  fail metadata invariant
```

CAS conflict or response loss at any step reloads durable state. `MAY_HAVE_COMMITTED` is resolved from the exact index
record, never inferred from an exception type.

### 6.3 Protection release

- source task protections remain until task is proven `PUBLISHED` and no recovery/checkpoint builder is reading the
  task snapshot；
- output task protection remains until committed visible-generation protection is re-proved；
- a task-owned visible-generation protection is CAS-rebound to the exact committed index before task publication；
- PREPARED/ABORTED output retains task protection during retry/orphan grace；
- terminal failed/cancelled tasks remove protections only after proving no PREPARED/COMMITTED index references the
  output。

## 7. Advisory Materialization Checkpoint

### 7.1 Reconciliation

The reconciler rebuilds the candidate cover from authoritative trim and advances `contiguousCoveredOffset` while
every offset is covered by a healthy `COMMITTED` generation satisfying the policy. It stores the highest source
commit version observed.

The implemented surface deliberately returns the exact durable wrapper so callers/tests can distinguish idempotent
replay from a successful CAS without treating either as visibility：

```java
public interface MaterializationCheckpointReconciler {
    CompletableFuture<VersionedMaterializationCheckpoint> reconcile(
            StreamId streamId,
            MaterializationPolicy policy,
            MaterializationTaskMutationGuard mutationGuard);
}
```

`DefaultMaterializationCheckpointReconciler` reloads L0 stream bounds、the exact registration/projection and the
policy checkpoint under one operation deadline. It scans at most 4,096 candidates with configured pages, rebuilds
coverage from authoritative trim rather than trusting the stored offset, and greedily chooses the farthest covering
whole committed range with generation/key tie-breaks. Existing progress ahead of the freshly verified cover is an
invariant failure until the later explicit corrupt-record repair path exists. Ordinary CAS is monotonic；a condition
conflict restarts the full proof (at most eight attempts), while any failed response whose reload equals the exact
desired value is converged success.

Rules：

- gaps、PREPARED、QUARANTINED or wrong policy stop advancement；
- an overlapping generation counts only for its declared coverage；
- task PUBLISHED without committed index does not count；
- committed index without task PUBLISHED does count and repairs the task asynchronously；
- checkpoint loss/corruption causes a bounded rebuild from trim/recovery root；
- primary WAL/source retention never uses the checkpoint alone。

Lag metrics are `head - verified checkpoint` plus exact unmaterialized source bytes/age; they are not calculated from
the number of task records.

### 7.2 Terminal workflow-metadata retirement

Task/checkpoint/stats deletion never changes read or append truth. The per-stream scanner may conditionally delete a
task only after `updatedAtMillis + metadataAuditGrace < now` and one of these complete proofs：

- `PUBLISHED`：the exact index is `COMMITTED`, its visible protection is owned by that index, the advisory checkpoint
  covers the task range/sequence and no task-owned source/output protection remains；
- `CANCELLED/TERMINAL_FAILED`：no `PREPARED/COMMITTED` index exists for its publication/output and every task-owned
  protection is absent after owner/root revalidation。

It reloads task/index/checkpoint/root immediately before `deleteTask(expectedVersion)`. Conflict or response loss
restarts from exact reads. A live stream keeps its current policy checkpoint. Stale `RangeRetentionStatsRecord`s are
conditionally removed when their whole range is below a stable completed trim or their source index identity/version
is gone；their absence only makes planning conservative. Sequence、current checkpoint and recovery-root removal is
reserved for the deleted-stream final proof in document 05. There is no time-only deletion of a non-terminal task.

The implemented `DefaultTerminalWorkflowMetadataRetirer` performs these steps under one bounded deadline and a
4,096-entry hard cap. `PUBLISHED` recovery no longer recreates temporary task protections after visibility is owned
by the exact committed index; this closes the race in which a concurrent recovery could recreate a protection between
the final empty scan and task deletion. The retirer validates the exact index-owned visible protection, releases only
canonical task-owned source/output protections after exact task/root revalidation, rescans every fact, revalidates
the live projection, and conditionally deletes the task. `CANCELLED/TERMINAL_FAILED` additionally scan the exact
offset-end generation prefix and reject any `PREPARED/COMMITTED` task/output reference. Protection and task delete
response loss converge by exact reload. Stats wholly below stable trim or whose exact source index key/version/digest
is gone are conditionally deleted. Old-policy checkpoints use two identical full task/index prefix snapshots around
projection revalidation; the current policy checkpoint is never deleted. The metadata store now exposes bounded
checkpoint scan pages and exact candidate-by-key lookup required by those proofs.

A live stream may conditionally retire an old `(policyId, policyVersion)` checkpoint after metadata audit grace only
when the current projection policy is a different exact version, every task for the old version is terminal/retired,
and an index/task-prefix rescan plus projection revalidation is unchanged. This never deletes the current-policy
checkpoint and never uses old progress to seed the new version.

## 8. Recovery Checkpoint Protocol

### 8.1 Why it is required

Current `StreamHeadRecord.lastCommitId` anchors a chain to genesis. Those commit records contain generation-zero
targets and are the repair/replay source. Deleting source bytes/index keys without replacing that role would make
append replay and missing-index repair depend on already deleted data.

F4 therefore changes the valid append proof from：

```text
head -> live commit nodes -> genesis
```

to：

```text
head -> bounded live tail -> RecoveryCheckpointRoot -> immutable NRC1 prefix
```

The head CAS remains the append linearization point. The checkpoint is a compaction of recovery evidence, not a new
append commit.

### 8.2 Eligible checkpoint prefix

A prefix ending at commit `C` is eligible only when：

- `C` is currently reachable from head or the previous active checkpoint bridge；
- every commit/range is fully reconstructed from exact current records；
- every untrimmed offset is covered by one or more healthy committed lossless generations；
- those target objects have `RECOVERY_CHECKPOINT_TARGET` protections；
- ranges wholly below completed L0 trim need no readable target but the checkpoint records their scalar chain/audit
  identity according to append replay grace；
- no exact in-process append recovery handle/task needs a source record being removed；
- source commits are older than `appendReplayGrace`；
- all NRC1 count/size/root bounds hold。

The coordinator never checkpoints a partial commit. `coveredEndOffset` is a commit boundary.

### 8.3 Build and publish

```text
read root R1 + head H
requireReady(RECOVERY_CHECKPOINT, exact live projection, activateIfAbsent=true)
walk and validate live commit prefix/tail bridge
read/lease committed generation records
generate checkpointAttemptId, canonicalize exact generic commit envelopes,
deduplicate exact COMMITTED generation-index codec bytes,
and build canonical NRC1 publication table/commit entries containing both
put-if-absent content-verified attempt-addressed checkpoint object;
  before every provider transmission, the guard reloads exact R1, attempt/set digest and optional root,
  and accepts only unchanged R1 plus absent root or the same ACTIVE identity
HEAD + full strict decode/checksum validation
create bounded RECOVERY_CHECKPOINT_PENDING protection on the checkpoint object,
  owned by exact R1 version + next sequence/object/set digest
reread head and root R2; require R2.version == R1.version and prefix remains reachable
revalidate activation proof, pending protection/root and its skew-safe expiry
construct new root Rnext (append or merge refs, monotonic coverage)
CAS recovery root R1 -> Rnext                 CHECKPOINT PUBLICATION
reread Rnext and checkpoint bytes
create permanent CHECKPOINT_OBJECT and CHECKPOINT_TARGET protections owned by exact Rnext
revalidate every target root/index and Rnext; remove pending protection
only then schedule old live commit/index/source retirement
```

CAS loss leaves a bounded pending protection and orphan checkpoint object that recovery can reuse if identical or
reclaim after expiry. If the root CAS succeeded but its response/permanent-protection writes were lost, root-domain
revalidation repairs permanent protections before removing pending. None of these workflow records changes replay
truth before the root CAS.

### 8.4 Live-tail bridge

After checkpoint publication：

- if `head.lastCommitId == root.lastCommitId`, the complete committed history is in the checkpoint and the live tail
  may be empty；
- otherwise walking back from head must reach a live commit whose `previousCommitId == root.lastCommitId` and whose
  offset/commitVersion/cumulative predecessor scalars equal root covered end；
- new append continues storing `previousCommitId = head.lastCommitId` even if that id is checkpoint-resident；
- chain readers detect the bridge from the recovery root rather than requiring the predecessor key to exist。

### 8.5 Replay and index repair

`searchAppendReplay` searches the bounded live tail first and then NRC1 directories by commit id/version. It decodes
the canonical commit envelope and runs the same request-vs-record validation as the live generic record. A checkpoint
entry returns the same stable offset/cumulative/schema/projection result；the historical primary target remains audit/
result identity only, while its current committed publication-table target is used for read repair.

`repairDerivedStreamIndexes`：

- below current L0 trim：returns a trimmed result and creates no index；
- inside checkpoint coverage：decodes the publication table's exact canonical committed-generation record,
  revalidates its physical root/protection/activation and `putIfAbsent` recreates or validates the identical index；
  it never regenerates a deleted generation-zero target；
- in live tail：uses the existing commit record path；
- a root change during either path restarts the proof。

The implemented terminal result is evidence-labelled as `TRIMMED`、`LIVE_COMMIT` or `RECOVERY_CHECKPOINT`.
Checkpoint success carries the exact restored `VersionedGenerationIndex` for audit/testing only；ordinary read
selection must discard that shortcut and run a fresh generation scan plus durable reader-pin handshake.

### 8.6 Merge and retirement

At 32 root references or configured object threshold, a merge task reads/pins current checkpoint objects and writes a
new NRC1 object with identical canonical entries. Root CAS atomically replaces the reference list. Old checkpoint
objects are GC candidates only after all replay readers release leases and the newer root is revalidated.

Live commit keys below the new root, their generic committed markers and generation-zero indexes become retirement
candidates. Conditional metadata deletion and physical source deletion follow document 05；root publication alone
does not perform those side effects.

## 9. Object-WAL Async Profile

### 9.1 Supported matrix after F4-M5

| Profile | Durability accepted | Success boundary | Secondary work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OBJECT_WAL_SYNC_OBJECT` | `WAL_DURABLE_AND_INDEX_COMMITTED` | protected head + protected generation-zero index | higher generation async |
| `OBJECT_WAL_ASYNC_OBJECT` | `WAL_DURABLE` | primary Object WAL + protected commit intent + head | gen-0 repair + higher generation async |
| `OBJECT_WAL_ASYNC_OBJECT` | `WAL_DURABLE_AND_INDEX_COMMITTED` | protected head + protected generation-zero index | higher generation async |
| all BookKeeper profiles | none until BK adapter gate | rejected before IO | F4 machinery remains reusable |

`OBJECT_WAL_ASYNC_OBJECT` still uploads its primary Object WAL to object storage before success. It removes secondary
index/read-optimized publication from the ack path；it is not a local-WAL latency claim. The full
BookKeeper-WAL-then-async-object profile requires the separate BookKeeper adapter.

### 9.2 Append state machine

```text
ACCEPT
 -> PROFILE/SESSION VALID
 -> OBJECT WAL PREPARED + UPLOADED
 -> COMMIT INTENT STORED/REUSED
 -> PHYSICAL ROOT ACTIVE + REACHABLE_APPEND PROTECTION ACQUIRED
 -> STREAM HEAD CAS/REPLAY PROVED
 -> if WAL_DURABLE: return exact AppendResult
 -> repair/materialize generation zero
 -> VISIBLE_GENERATION PROTECTION ACQUIRED FOR EXACT INDEX
 -> if INDEX_COMMITTED: return exact AppendResult
 -> planner discovers higher-generation work
```

The concrete two-stage interfaces、identities and crash cuts are document 03 §10. `AppendCoordinator` no longer calls
one combined metadata `commitStableAppend`; it invokes prepare, `GenerationZeroPhysicalReferencePublisher`, then the
protected head commit. `GenerationZeroIndexMaterializer` returns `MaterializedGenerationZero`, so strict success can
prove the exact index-owned protection instead of assuming that a successful index put is physically durable.
Append recovery runs the same idempotent sequence and never acknowledges from an unprotected replay result.

Admission proves the exact stream registration and current projection activation before primary IO；a stream cannot
enter the async profile with only an in-memory enqueue path. The ack does not wait for task creation. A crash after
head commit but before enqueue is repaired when the durable registry scan reloads the authoritative head and scans the
anchor-reachable commit history/index gap. Therefore task loss、watch loss、topic unload and broker failover cannot lose
acknowledged data or permanently hide its materialization work.

### 9.3 Read after `WAL_DURABLE`

When ordinary resolve finds no index at a committed offset：

1. read head/recovery root and prove the offset committed；
2. run the existing bounded `repairDerivedStreamIndexes` against live tail/checkpoint；
3. re-resolve the new generation-zero/higher entry；
4. finish within the caller read deadline or return a retriable metadata/materialization error；
5. never return empty/end-of-stream for an index gap below committed end。

F4 configuration reserves separate repair concurrency so a materialization backlog cannot starve read-after-write.

#### 9.3.1 Implemented checkpoint AD boundary

Checkpoint AD implements the core boundary without prematurely enabling it in the broker runtime：

- `Phase4StorageProfileResolver` accepts the exact matrix in §9.1 and still rejects all BookKeeper profiles before IO；
- the existing `AppendCoordinator` protected-intent/root/`REACHABLE_APPEND`/head sequence is unchanged；
- after a proved stable head, `AsyncObjectWalAppendCoordinator` returns immediately for `WAL_DURABLE` and launches
  generation-zero materialization plus `VISIBLE_GENERATION` protection under an independent timeout；
- strict durability waits for that exact protection and propagates its failure；
- detached failure does not suspend the append lane or revoke the already returned stable offset；
- `GenerationZeroRepairScanner` reconstructs only root-stable live-tail generation zero and never regenerates an
  NRC1-retired primary target；
- `ReadAfterStableCommitRepair` is injectable as the live branch of `CheckpointDerivedIndexRepairer`, so a committed
  index gap receives physical protection before re-resolve；
- both Object-WAL profiles are accepted by the F4 `GenerationReadResolver`.

Legacy `DefaultStreamStorage` constructors continue to install `Phase15StorageProfileResolver`. The new explicit
resolver constructor is an integration seam, not a rollout switch. Checkpoint AE implements the exact
registration/topic-marker/lag admission seam described below, but production remains disabled until the provider
installs that seam together with the F4 generation resolver/checkpoint composite/scanner lifecycle.

#### 9.3.2 Implemented checkpoint AE admission and lag truth

`AppendCoordinator` captures the canonical L0 storage profile before enqueue, then executes
`AppendAdmissionGuard.admit(AppendAdmissionRequest)` inside the stream lane before expected-offset initialization、
session acquisition and `WalObjectWriter.prepare`. This ordering is normative：

```text
validate L0 profile
 -> enqueue on exact stream lane
 -> activation + lag admission
 -> load/init expected offset
 -> acquire/reuse append session
 -> prepare/upload primary WAL
 -> protected stable commit
```

Admission timeout is the append's remaining monotonic deadline. Any activation, metadata, throttle or scheduler
failure completes as `KNOWN_NOT_COMMITTED` because no primary bytes have been prepared. Append recovery does not run
the admission guard：backpressure may stop new async work, but it may never stop convergence of a previously prepared
or committed append.

For a managed-ledger async append, `ManagedLedgerAsyncAppendAdmissionGuard`：

1. loads `getProjectionByStream(cluster, streamId)`；
2. requires exact binding/current-topic/stream/name/projection identity and a live `OPEN` or `SEALED` facade；
3. requires both L0 and topic projection to remain `OBJECT_WAL_ASYNC_OBJECT`；
4. derives the canonical NPR1 `LiveProjectionSubject`；
5. obtains `GenerationOperation.GENERATION_PUBLISH` readiness with first-marker activation allowed；
6. runs `MaterializationLagGate`；
7. revalidates the exact activation proof immediately before returning to the stream lane.

The lag reader independently rebuilds current-policy visibility. Starting at logical trim, it repeatedly chooses the
healthy current-policy `COMMITTED` generation that covers the cursor and reaches the farthest offset, with generation
and UTF-8 key tie-breaks. Every selected index must match stream/view/head bounds、policy SHA、
materialization-policy SHA、projection ref and a decodable NCP1 compacted target. The stored materialization
checkpoint is advisory：`checkpoint.covered <= rebuilt.covered` is allowed；an ahead checkpoint is an invariant
violation and cannot hide a coverage gap.

Records and bytes are then exact arithmetic：

```text
lagRecords = stableHeadOffset - rebuiltCoveredOffset
lagBytes   = stableHeadCumulativeBytes - cumulativeBytesAt(rebuiltCoveredOffset)
oldestAge  = now - preparedAtMillis(oldest unmaterialized canonical commit)
```

The cumulative/age fact comes from a recovery-root-double-read live tail. If the rebuilt coverage starts before the
NRC1 anchor, `RangeRetentionStatsRecord` values must form one contiguous chain to the anchor；each source index key、
metadata version、durable digest、offset/commit/cumulative coverage is reloaded and checked, and the chain's final
cumulative bytes must equal the first live commit's cumulative start. Missing or contradictory stats fail closed.
The complete stream snapshot、registration、recovery root and rebuilt coverage are revalidated；authority drift retries
at most four complete measurements.

### 9.4 Lag/backpressure

Signals：

```text
nereus_materialization_lag_offsets{profile,view}
nereus_materialization_lag_bytes{profile,view}
nereus_materialization_oldest_lag_seconds{profile,view}
nereus_materialization_registry_scan_total{outcome,shard}
nereus_materialization_registry_scan_age_seconds
nereus_materialization_registration_mismatch_total{reason}
nereus_materialization_task_count{state,failure_class}
nereus_materialization_publish_total{outcome}
nereus_materialization_primary_fallback_total{target_type}
nereus_materialization_append_throttle_total{reason}
nereus_materialization_append_reject_total{reason}
```

At throttle threshold, append admission applies bounded delay before primary IO. At reject threshold/age, new async
appends fail retriably before primary IO while reads/repair/workers continue. Existing acknowledged primary ranges are
never discarded to reduce lag.

Each records/bytes/age threshold uses zero as an individual disable value. Throttle applies at most one configured
delay（default 25ms），then performs a fresh authoritative measurement；reject thresholds are checked both before and
after that delay. If all thresholds are disabled, the reader is not invoked.

## 10. Worker/Runtime Close

Close order：

```text
stop registry/planner/task scans and reject new claims
stop append-side task hints
allow admitted publication CAS/recovery to resolve until deadline
stop claim heartbeats; release local source/read leases
leave durable tasks/protections for another process
close GC/checkpoint coordinators and complete the runtime close future
outer provider then shuts worker/scheduler/callback executors
outer provider closes metadata/object dependencies only after every F4 future has drained

Close never CASes a possibly committed task back to retry without first reconciling its index. Executor rejection is
handled like an async failure and completes every admitted future exactly once.

## 11. Failure Matrix

| Failure | Durable state | Recovery/outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| duplicate planners create same task | one deterministic key | compare identical and share task |
| registration create/refresh response lost | one versioned shard key | reload exact identity；never create a second route |
| topic unload/restart with no task | registration + committed head | shard scan recreates deterministic task from head/index gap |
| registration stale/missing/mismatched | never stream truth | skip mutation；broker activation/async admission fails closed |
| worker dies after claim | expired `CLAIMED` | new claim after skew-safe expiry |
| source GC marks during protection acquisition | root epoch/state changes | protection post-check fails；cancel/replan |
| source changes after protection | immutable bytes + protection | task remains valid；publish admission may replan for efficiency |
| worker uploads before output CAS | unreferenced content-verified attempt object | attach on same-claim retry or orphan GC |
| worker loses claim before a provider retry | exact guard reload fails | no retry bytes sent；new claim uses a fresh output key |
| output CAS succeeds, response lost | `OUTPUT_READY` | reload exact output |
| generation allocated, process dies | counter gap/task may record G | gap safe；reconcile task before new allocation |
| PREPARED index, worker dies | invisible PREPARED | recovery commits or aborts |
| COMMITTED index, task still PUBLISHING | visible index | repair task/checkpoint from index |
| terminal task delete races checkpoint/index change | expected-version/final revalidation loses | retain and retry；visibility unchanged |
| checkpoint upload, root CAS loses | old root authoritative | reuse identical bytes or orphan GC |
| checkpoint owner/root changes before provider retry | guarded transmission is rejected | rebuild with a fresh checkpoint attempt id |
| root CAS succeeds before commit-key retirement | new checkpoint authoritative | idempotent retirement resumes |
| commit key deleted while old replay scan runs | old scan fails final root version check | restart against checkpoint |
| append intent stored before physical protection | head unchanged | retry root/protection handshake；no acknowledgement |
| protected head commits before gen-0 index | head/commit + `REACHABLE_APPEND` authoritative | async ack legal；read repair or retriable timeout, never false EOS |
| gen-0 index exists before index protection | reachable protection remains | repair `VISIBLE_GENERATION` before strict success or commit retirement |
| object store unavailable | tasks retry；primary Object WAL reads may also fail | backpressure, no metadata visibility change |
| shutdown during publish response loss | task/index may have committed | next process exact reconciliation |

## 12. Deterministic Test Contract

Tests inject failure immediately before and after every task/index/root CAS and every object PUT/HEAD/read. Required
models include：

- two planners and four workers on the same/overlapping ranges；
- 64-shard fairness、pagination restart、stale hint/watch loss and duplicate registry scanners；
- unloaded stream with committed head but no task is rediscovered after a fresh process starts；
- claim expiry/heartbeat/clock-skew boundary and stale worker output CAS；
- exact source reader refusing silent generation substitution；
- all publication response-loss outcomes；
- task/checkpoint corruption and rebuild from index；
- terminal task/stale stats conditional retirement, response loss and no deletion before audit grace；
- recovery checkpoint root changes during append、replay、repair and merge；
- deletion of every old live commit key only after checkpoint publication；
- async ack crash before task/gen-0 index plus restart read repair；
- every prepare/root/protection/head/index-protection cut for sync and async durability, including response loss；
- lag throttle/reject before IO and recovery workers continuing under backpressure；
- close/executor rejection with no hung or duplicate completion。
