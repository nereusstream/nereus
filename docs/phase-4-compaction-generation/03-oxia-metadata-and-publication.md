# Oxia Metadata and Generation Publication

## 1. Correctness Domains

Phase 4 metadata is split deliberately：

| Domain | Authoritative record | Linearization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| generation number allocation | `GenerationSequenceRecord` | counter version-CAS |
| physical target visibility | one `GenerationIndexRecord` | same-key `PREPARED -> COMMITTED` CAS |
| stream work discovery | `MaterializationStreamRegistrationRecord` | registration CAS；hint only，never stream truth |
| task workflow | `MaterializationTaskRecord` | task same-key CAS；never read visibility |
| materialization progress | `MaterializationCheckpointRecord` | progress CAS；never read visibility |
| append/recovery prefix | `RecoveryCheckpointRootRecord` + immutable NRC1 bytes | root CAS |
| logical trim | existing `CursorRetentionRecord` + `StreamHeadRecord` | existing F3 pending protocol/head CAS |
| object deletion | `PhysicalObjectRootRecord` | lifecycle CAS；object-store delete is a later side effect |
| read protection | `ObjectReaderLeaseRecord` | lease create/CAS followed by object-root revalidation |
| durable reference | `ObjectProtectionRecord` | protection create followed by object-root revalidation |

No task、checkpoint、watch、cache or object listing can substitute for an authoritative record named for another
domain. The stream registration owns enumeration only；it never proves work、visibility or deletion eligibility.

### 1.1 Implemented F4-M1 checkpoint

The production Oxia adapter and deterministic partition-aware test backend now execute generation allocation/index、
task、checkpoint、range-stat、recovery-root、64-shard stream-registration、256-shard physical-root and exact
conditional-delete contracts. A repeated generation-index or task create is accepted after response loss only when
its immutable publication/planning identity matches the existing value；a checkpoint policy-version collision also
requires the same policy digest. `PhysicalObjectRootTransitions` is shared by production and fake stores and rejects
identity mutation、illegal lifecycle edges、non-unit epoch changes and invalid DELETED audit replacement.

The adapter now also reloads the exact expected version before every ordinary CAS. `GenerationMetadataTransitions`
enforces closed index/task edges、immutable planning/publication identity、monotonic checkpoint and registration
progress、immutable retention boundaries and monotonic one-sequence-at-a-time recovery-root publication. The 43
frozen codec vectors cover every lifecycle/optional branch, and the real Oxia restart/CAS/pagination/delete source
runs with slash-aware fixed-depth bounds. `phase4M1Check` and `phase4M1FinalCheck --rerun-tasks` passed on
2026-07-15. Nothing in M1 enables generation publication or physical deletion；those paths remain M2–M4 work.

### 1.2 F4-M2 implementation checkpoint

`GenerationAllocator` now exposes the view-scoped sequence allocation contract without creating a second counter
owner. `GenerationMetadataStore.getCandidate` and the production Oxia adapter provide an exact
`(streamId, readView, offsetEnd, generation)` lookup while preserving old generation-zero and F4 union decoding.
`GenerationIndexValidator` admits only strict `COMMITTED` higher-generation records, verifies stream/view/head
bounds, target identity, codec checksum and canonical projection decoding, and keeps generation-zero compatibility
separate.

The matching core resolver performs a fresh authoritative view-scoped scan for every resolve, enforces a 4096-entry
hard bound, ignores non-COMMITTED lifecycle records, selects the highest covering generation, resolves physical
identity from the root (or the narrowly allowed generation-zero manifest bootstrap), acquires the durable reader
lease and then reloads both the exact candidate and stream head before returning it. This is an intermediate M2
checkpoint only。`ReadCoordinator` now retains the lease through exact-reader IO and terminal cleanup, excludes a
failed exact candidate only inside the current operation/view, and performs a fresh resolve for fallback. Missing or
checksum-corrupt immutable objects best-effort CAS the exact root, selected higher index and every bounded-scan
discovered `COMMITTED` index in the same stream/view that references the same object key to `QUARANTINED`. Retriable
`OBJECT_READ_FAILED` performs fresh same-candidate resolve/read attempts up to `GenerationReadRetryPolicy` (default
two retries) before same-view fallback and never changes health metadata.

`nereus-materialization` now also contains strict policy/source/task/output values、canonical source/policy/task
identity、secure publication-id generation、durable task/output/index mapping、exact HEAD plus task-aware full-format
verification and a shared monotonic operation deadline. The M3 bridge now streams whole-file CRC/SHA verification
and checks the Parquet policy digest against the exact publishing task. `DefaultGenerationCommitter` implements the restart-safe
publication state machine: it freezes publication id, attaches one allocated view-scoped generation to the durable
task, creates the deterministic `PREPARED` index, revalidates exact task/output/head/source/root/activation/protection
facts, and exposes the result only through the exact index `PREPARED -> COMMITTED` version-CAS. It then transfers
`VISIBLE_GENERATION` ownership from the task to the exact index and marks the task `PUBLISHED`. Exact reloads converge
concurrent publishers and lost task/index CAS responses; an exactly proven `ABORTED` allocation releases its old
task-owned visible protection, returns the task to `OUTPUT_READY`, and retries with a fresh publication id and
generation while retaining the old `ABORTED` index. `GenerationPublicationReconciler` is the idempotent re-entry
surface for an already recovered durable task/output pair; task discovery remains M3 worker work.

`phase4M2Check` and `phase4M2FinalCheck --rerun-tasks` passed on 2026-07-15. The real Oxia/LocalStack final fixture
uses independent client runtimes to prove concurrent-publisher convergence and COMMITTED-response-loss recovery
across restart, then proves exact pin release、root/index quarantine and same-view generation-zero fallback after a
higher object disappears. The fixture also exposed and fixed inline `EntryIndexRef` value equality across durable
codec round-trips. F4-M2 is complete/final-gated. M3 now implements the compacted-object worker、source/output
task-protection creation/crash-cut owner reconciliation、monotonic advisory checkpoint CAS and bounded service
lifecycle；the Pulsar Entry/NCP1 opaque-byte round trip passes and the topic-compaction neutral SPI/registry is
implemented. Terminal workflow-metadata retirement now uses exact task/index/checkpoint/root/protection proofs and
conditional deletes. COMMITTED-source topic bootstrap、tagged-v1 NTC1 keys、the sorted-spill two-pass engine、worker
and isolated TOPIC_COMPACTED publication path are now implemented and M3 ordinary/final-gated. M4 owns full
recovery-root/anchor-aware source reachability before retirement or physical deletion can be enabled.

### 1.3 F4-M3 planning/recovery checkpoint

The production task codec now embeds `MaterializationPolicyRecord`, a complete immutable policy snapshot whose
id/version/view/task-kind fields must match the task root. `MaterializationRecordMapper` reconstructs historical
tasks and outputs from durable bytes without the current configuration. The task create response-loss identity
intentionally excludes `createdAtMillis`: two brokers planning the same deterministic task with different clocks
converge on the existing record, while all later task CAS transitions retain and compare the original creation time.
The frozen task vectors were regenerated for this still-unreleased V1 shape.

The M3 checkpoint also implements and tests the bounded whole-index planner、source mapper、task-store revalidation、
per-stream task recovery and all-64-shard registered-stream scanner. These are orchestration building blocks, not a
new visibility owner：registration remains a liveness trigger, the planner reloads L0 head/trim and generation-index
truth, task creation revalidates every exact source plus activation proof, and only the M2 generation-index CAS may
publish output. Exact-source worker IO、checkpoint/service orchestration and Pulsar exact-byte evidence are now
implemented；the topic-compaction neutral SPI/registry and proof-driven terminal workflow-metadata retirement are
also implemented. Topic tasks now persist exact COMMITTED source indexes, execute the bounded two-pass engine and
publish sparse NTC1 output only through a TOPIC_COMPACTED index. Focused worker/publication tests and the real
Oxia/LocalStack two-worker/restart/response-loss gate pass；F4-M3 is complete/final-gated.

### 1.4 F4-M4 protected generation-zero append checkpoint

Section 10 is now implemented in `OxiaMetadataStore`、`OxiaJavaClientMetadataStore` and
`FakeOxiaMetadataStore`. `prepareStableAppend` writes/reloads only the deterministic generic intent and returns its
exact key/version/durable SHA without changing the head. `commitPreparedStableAppend` accepts the primitive root and
protection proof carried by `ProtectedStableAppend`, then reloads the intent、ACTIVE root and canonical permanent
`REACHABLE_APPEND` owner before every head CAS/replay decision. Missing or changed proof fails before a head mutation.

`materializeGenerationZero` now returns `MaterializedGenerationZero` with the exact index key/version/durable SHA；
`revalidateMaterializedGenerationZero` re-proves index bytes、commit bytes and current head reachability for the
`VISIBLE_GENERATION` owner handshake. `DefaultGenerationZeroPhysicalReferencePublisher` creates/reloads both
permanent protections through `DefaultObjectProtectionManager` and revalidates the owner/root after the no-gap
handshake. Ordinary append and exact append recovery use the same sequence. The production Pulsar runtime constructs
the physical store/manager/publisher over its shared Oxia client and owns their close order.

This checkpoint closes the new-write physical-reference gap only. Recovery-root publication is implemented by the
following checkpoint D；anchor-aware replay/repair、source/index retirement and physical GC remain unimplemented, so
deletion stays disabled and F4-M4 remains in progress.

### 1.5 F4-M4 guarded recovery-root publication checkpoint

`RecoveryCheckpointCoordinator` now executes the bounded checkpoint plan through guarded if-absent object upload、
exact HEAD and full NRC1 verification、root-owned pending protection and the recovery-root CAS. Activation、current
root、every exact committed target and the builder plan are revalidated before each provider attempt and publication
mutation. A lost CAS response is accepted only after an exact root reload proves that the desired replacement is
already authoritative；uploaded bytes and workflow state never substitute for root truth.

After publication, `RecoveryCheckpointRootReconciler` pages the immutable NRC1 publication table, reloads every
embedded generation index from Oxia, distinguishes the raw record SHA from the durable Oxia-envelope SHA, and repairs
both checkpoint-object and target permanent protections before deleting the deterministic pending protection. The
same reconciliation runs before the next build, so restart converges when a process exits after root CAS but before
the protection writes. Checkpoint-aware replay/index repair、source retirement and GC are deliberately not enabled by
this checkpoint.

### 1.6 F4-M4 checkpoint-aware append replay checkpoint

`CheckpointAppendReplayReader` now consumes the root/head protocol in §13. It searches the exact bounded live tail
first, then selects the one current-root NRC1 reference covering `CommitAppendRequest.expectedStartOffset`, acquires a
durable read pin, validates the complete reference/header/object identity and resolves the canonical entry through
the sparse offset directory. `AppendReplayRecords` is the single request-vs-record validator/hydrator used by both
live Oxia replay and checkpoint replay, preventing the two paths from drifting.

The reader revalidates the exact versioned root during pin admission and after the object lookup；a changed root
restarts the complete proof at most eight times. `AppendCoordinator` receives the terminal search through an explicit
`AppendRecoverySearcher` seam. A checkpoint hit is already a current-root reachability proof and does not recreate
the historical generation-zero target；a live hit retains the existing protected recovery sequence. The existing
default storage constructors still select the live-only adapter until F4 runtime composition explicitly injects the
checkpoint reader, and no metadata retirement is enabled by this checkpoint.

### 1.7 F4-M4 checkpoint-derived index repair checkpoint

`GenerationMetadataStore.restoreCommittedFromCheckpoint` is the only new mutation used by NRC1 repair. It accepts an
unhydrated `COMMITTED`/`COMMITTED-view` `GenerationIndexRecord` plus the NRC1 raw-record SHA. The production adapter
re-encodes and checks that raw digest, writes the ordinary final generation-index key with put-if-absent, and handles
create conflict/response uncertainty by exact reload. Reload converges only when every canonical field matches after
metadata-version hydration and `GenerationIndexDigests.durableValueSha256(record)` matches the stored Oxia envelope.
It cannot synthesize `PREPARED` state or use publication identity alone to accept a collision.

`CheckpointDerivedIndexRepairer` remains a consumer of existing authorities：recovery root selects immutable NRC1；
publication rows supply frozen committed-index bytes；physical root supplies target lifecycle/identity；root-owned
`RECOVERY_CHECKPOINT_TARGET` protection blocks physical deletion；activation and trim remain independent authorities.
Before the final-key create and again afterward, the repairer reloads/revalidates those facts. A root change raises a
private retry signal and restarts from snapshot/walk；an already-trimmed target returns `TRIMMED` with no metadata
write. A concurrent identical restore is idempotent；a different value at the same final key is an invariant violation.

`GenerationReadResolver` now accepts a `GenerationIndexRepairer`. Its compatibility constructor installs
`MetadataGenerationIndexRepairer` for live commits；F4 runtime composition must explicitly inject the checkpoint-aware
implementation. After either repair source reports terminal success, resolver performs a new authoritative index
scan and the existing physical read-pin revalidation. Repair evidence never becomes a parallel visibility domain.

### 1.8 F4-M4 exact retirement metadata checkpoint

Checkpoint G implements the focused `retirement` package and keeps it intentionally narrower than the ordinary
metadata stores. `SharedOxiaClientRuntime.retirementMetadataClient` lends only exact `get` and
`deleteIfVersion`, and accepts only a package-constructible opaque `RetirementMetadataKey`；the adapter cannot
create、CAS-update、scan or list metadata, while unrelated runtime callers cannot forge arbitrary delete keys. The source adapter supports both
legacy and generic generation-zero index/marker/commit encodings, verifies the canonical key against strictly decoded
record identity, requires encoded `metadataVersion == 0`, then compares the captured Oxia version and SHA-256 of the
exact stored envelope before conditional delete.

The design API now includes `getCommittedMarker` and `VersionedGenerationZeroMarker`. This is required because the
ordinary generation scan and append-tail APIs expose the index and commit node but do not expose the separate
committed-marker version/digest needed to freeze a recoverable retirement plan. The object-audit adapter returns
hydrated manifest/reference wrappers while retaining the pre-hydration stored-envelope digest. Neither adapter treats
absence or response uncertainty as success；the future coordinator must prove idempotence under the same unchanged
recovery/physical-root attempt. This checkpoint enables no caller or physical delete by itself.

## 2. Keyspace

All keys use a new `F4Keyspace` delegating common stream/object components to `OxiaKeyspace`. Human-readable examples
below omit `KeyComponentCodec` encoding；implementation must never concatenate raw identities.

```text
# per-stream, same stream PartitionKey
/nereus/clusters/{cluster}/streams/{streamId}/materialization/v1/tasks/{taskId}
/nereus/clusters/{cluster}/streams/{streamId}/materialization/v1/checkpoints/{policyId}/{policyVersion019}
/nereus/clusters/{cluster}/streams/{streamId}/materialization/v1/generation-sequences/{viewId02}
/nereus/clusters/{cluster}/streams/{streamId}/recovery/v1/root
/nereus/clusters/{cluster}/streams/{streamId}/retention/v1/range-stats/{offsetEnd019}/{commitVersion019}

# cluster work discovery, 64 deterministic shards; never stream truth
/nereus/clusters/{cluster}/materialization/v1/stream-registry/{shard02}/{streamId}

# COMMITTED view: existing path, generation 0 and higher generation coexist
/nereus/clusters/{cluster}/streams/{streamId}/offset-index/{offsetEnd019}/{generation019}

# TOPIC_COMPACTED view: never scanned by ordinary resolve
/nereus/clusters/{cluster}/streams/{streamId}/views/v1/topic-compacted/
  offset-index/{offsetEnd019}/{generation019}

# physical-object metadata, 256 deterministic shards
/nereus/clusters/{cluster}/physical-objects/v1/{shard03}/roots/{objectKeyHash}
/nereus/clusters/{cluster}/physical-objects/v1/{shard03}/objects/{objectKeyHash}/readers/{processRunId}
/nereus/clusters/{cluster}/physical-objects/v1/{shard03}/objects/{objectKeyHash}/protections/{typeId02}/{referenceId}

# cluster rollout, its own cluster capability partition
/nereus/clusters/{cluster}/capabilities/generation-v1/activation
```

`offsetEnd019` and `generation019` use the existing lexicographically ordered non-negative-long encoding. `viewId02`
is the two-digit durable wire id (`01` committed, `02` topic-compacted). `taskId`、`referenceId` and `processRunId`
are encoded components and are revalidated from record content.

Every key under `/streams/{streamId}/...` above uses `OxiaKeyspace.streamPartitionKey(streamId)`. Physical-object
`shard03` is `000..255`, the unsigned first byte of the SHA-256 represented by `ObjectKeyHash`; all records for one
object use `PartitionKey("physical-object-v1-" + shard03)`. This preserves root/lease/protection co-location while
allowing a process to enumerate every lifecycle root after restart. Registry shard `shard02` is the two-digit value
`00..63` obtained from the
low six bits of SHA-256 over the canonical UTF-8 `StreamId`；all entries in one shard use
`PartitionKey("materialization-registry-v1-" + shard02)`. Co-location does not grant a transaction；only one key is
mutated per CAS.

## 3. Key-builder Surface

```java
public final class F4Keyspace {
    public int materializationRegistryShard(StreamId streamId);
    public String materializationRegistryKey(StreamId streamId);
    public String materializationRegistryPrefix(int shard);
    public String taskKey(StreamId streamId, String taskId);
    public String taskPrefix(StreamId streamId);
    public String checkpointKey(StreamId streamId, String policyId, long policyVersion);
    public String checkpointPrefix(StreamId streamId);
    public String generationSequenceKey(StreamId streamId, ReadView view);
    public String generationIndexKey(
            StreamId streamId, ReadView view, long offsetEnd, long generation);
    public String generationIndexPrefix(StreamId streamId, ReadView view);
    public String generationIndexScanFrom(StreamId streamId, ReadView view, long offsetEndInclusive);
    public String generationIndexScanToAfterEnd(
            StreamId streamId, ReadView view, long offsetEndInclusive);
    public String recoveryRootKey(StreamId streamId);
    public String retentionStatsKey(StreamId streamId, long offsetEnd, long commitVersion);
    public String retentionStatsPrefix(StreamId streamId);
    public String retentionStatsScanFrom(StreamId streamId, long offsetEndInclusive);
    public String retentionStatsScanToAfterEnd(StreamId streamId, long offsetEndInclusive);
    public String generationProtocolActivationKey();
    public PartitionKey generationProtocolActivationPartitionKey();

    public int physicalObjectShard(ObjectKeyHash object);
    public PartitionKey physicalObjectPartitionKey(ObjectKeyHash object);
    public String physicalRootKey(ObjectKeyHash object);
    public String physicalRootShardPrefix(int shard);
    public String readerLeaseKey(ObjectKeyHash object, String processRunId);
    public String protectionKey(
            ObjectKeyHash object, ObjectProtectionType type, String referenceId);
    public String protectionPrefix(ObjectKeyHash object);
    public String readerPrefix(ObjectKeyHash object);
}
```

Oxia orders hierarchical keys with slash-aware semantics, so scan bounds must not use a Java-string successor of a
trailing slash. `generationIndexScanToAfterEnd` and `retentionStatsScanToAfterEnd` use the next fixed-width offset
sub-prefix when `offsetEnd < Long.MAX_VALUE`；at `Long.MAX_VALUE` they use the reserved `.../~/` upper sentinel.
Canonical key components cannot contain `!` or `~`. Generic fixed-depth scans use half-open bounds
`[base + "/", base + "/~")` for one descendant segment and `[base + "/!/", base + "/~/")` for two；the latter is
used by protection records while reader/root scans stay at their exact depth. The logical token prefix remains
`base + "/"`, but the physical range bound carries the required depth. Unit and real-Oxia tests assert exact keys、
prefix upper bounds、long ordering、encoded path traversal resistance、bounded list/range inclusion and that the
ordinary/index view cannot produce the topic-compacted prefix. Physical-object tests freeze hash-byte shard vectors、
root-only prefix bounds and same-object partition equality across root/reader/protection keys.
The activation key is the fixed cluster key shown above and uses
`PartitionKey("generation-protocol-v1")`; no stream/object key may share that partition accidentally.

## 4. Metadata Store Interfaces

Phase 4 does not add all methods to the already broad `OxiaMetadataStore`. It adds focused stores backed by the same
`SharedOxiaClientRuntime`：

```java
public interface GenerationMetadataStore extends AutoCloseable {
    CompletableFuture<Optional<VersionedGenerationSequence>> getSequence(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, ReadView view);
    CompletableFuture<VersionedGenerationSequence> getOrCreateSequence(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, ReadView view);

    CompletableFuture<AllocatedGeneration> allocateGeneration(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, ReadView view, PublicationId publicationId);
    CompletableFuture<Void> deleteSequence(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, ReadView view, long expectedVersion);

    CompletableFuture<VersionedGenerationIndex> createPrepared(
            String cluster, GenerationIndexRecord record);

    CompletableFuture<VersionedGenerationIndex> compareAndSetIndex(
            String cluster, GenerationIndexRecord replacement, long expectedVersion);

    CompletableFuture<Optional<VersionedGenerationIndex>> getIndex(
            String cluster, GenerationIndexIdentity identity);

    CompletableFuture<Optional<VersionedGenerationCandidate>> getCandidate(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, ReadView view,
            long offsetEnd, long generation);
    CompletableFuture<Optional<VersionedGenerationCandidate>> getCandidateByKey(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, ReadView view, String indexKey);

    CompletableFuture<GenerationScanPage> scanIndex(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, ReadView view,
            long minOffsetEndInclusive, long maxOffsetEndInclusive,
            Optional<F4ScanToken> continuation, int limit);

    CompletableFuture<Void> deleteIndex(

    CompletableFuture<Optional<VersionedMaterializationTask>> getTask(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, String taskId);
    CompletableFuture<VersionedMaterializationTask> compareAndSetTask(

    CompletableFuture<Optional<VersionedMaterializationCheckpoint>> getMaterializationCheckpoint(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, String policyId, long policyVersion);
    CompletableFuture<VersionedMaterializationCheckpoint> getOrCreateMaterializationCheckpoint(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, String policyId,
            long policyVersion, Checksum policySha256);
    CompletableFuture<VersionedMaterializationCheckpoint> compareAndSetMaterializationCheckpoint(
            String cluster, MaterializationCheckpointRecord checkpoint, long expectedVersion);
    CompletableFuture<MaterializationCheckpointScanPage> scanMaterializationCheckpoints(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId,
            Optional<F4ScanToken> continuation, int limit);
    CompletableFuture<Void> deleteMaterializationCheckpoint(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, String policyId,
            long policyVersion, long expectedVersion);

    CompletableFuture<VersionedRangeRetentionStats> createRangeRetentionStats(
            String cluster, RangeRetentionStatsRecord stats);
    CompletableFuture<Optional<VersionedRangeRetentionStats>> getRangeRetentionStats(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, long offsetEnd, long commitVersion);
    CompletableFuture<VersionedRangeRetentionStats> compareAndSetRangeRetentionStats(
            String cluster, RangeRetentionStatsRecord stats, long expectedVersion);
    CompletableFuture<RangeRetentionStatsScanPage> scanRangeRetentionStats(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId,
            long minOffsetEndInclusive, long maxOffsetEndInclusive,
            Optional<F4ScanToken> continuation, int limit);
    CompletableFuture<Void> deleteRangeRetentionStats(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId,
            long offsetEnd, long commitVersion, long expectedVersion);

    CompletableFuture<VersionedMaterializationStreamRegistration> createOrVerifyStreamRegistration(
            String cluster, MaterializationStreamRegistrationRecord registration);
    CompletableFuture<Optional<VersionedMaterializationStreamRegistration>> getStreamRegistration(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId);
    CompletableFuture<VersionedMaterializationStreamRegistration> compareAndSetStreamRegistration(
            String cluster, MaterializationStreamRegistrationRecord registration, long expectedVersion);
    CompletableFuture<StreamRegistrationScanPage> scanStreamRegistrations(
            String cluster, int shard,
            Optional<F4ScanToken> continuation, int limit);
    CompletableFuture<Void> deleteStreamRegistration(

    CompletableFuture<VersionedRecoveryCheckpointRoot> getOrCreateRecoveryRoot(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId);
    CompletableFuture<VersionedRecoveryCheckpointRoot> compareAndSetRecoveryRoot(
            String cluster, RecoveryCheckpointRootRecord root, long expectedVersion);
    CompletableFuture<Void> deleteRecoveryRoot(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, long expectedVersion);
}
```

The public identities、version wrappers and page values are closed, rather than raw strings/maps：

        StreamId streamId, ReadView view, long offsetEnd, long generation) { }

        List<VersionedObjectProtection> values,
        Optional<F4ScanToken> continuation) { }
```

`GenerationIndexIdentity` requires `generation >= 1` and is therefore never used to delete generation zero. The
committed-view scan deliberately returns a sealed union because one physical prefix contains legacy generation-zero、
generic generation-zero and F4 records. Topic-compacted scans can return only `VersionedGenerationIndex`; observing a
generation-zero encoding there is corruption. No decoder may skip an unknown record type and still advance the page.

Every wrapper recomputes its exact key from the decoded value, requires `value.metadataVersion() == metadataVersion`
and stores `durableValueSha256 = SHA-256(exact NRM1 value bytes returned by Oxia)`. The digest is over stored bytes,
not a re-encoded hydrated record；this is the value used by source snapshots and conditional retirement. Page lists
are immutable、strictly key-ordered、contain at most the requested limit and share one scope with their continuation.
An empty/non-full page has no continuation；a full page has one unless the backend atomically proved end-of-prefix.

All metadata scans share one process-local, scope-bound token：

```java
public enum F4ScanKind {
    GENERATION_INDEX, MATERIALIZATION_TASK, MATERIALIZATION_CHECKPOINT, RETENTION_STATS,
    STREAM_REGISTRATION, PHYSICAL_ROOT, READER_LEASE, OBJECT_PROTECTION
}

public final class F4ScanToken {
    private final String cluster;
    private final F4ScanKind kind;
    private final String scopeIdentitySha256;
    private final String scanPrefix;
    private final String exclusiveLastKey;

    // package-private constructor/accessors; callers can only pass a returned token
}
```

Scope identity canonically hashes kind plus stream/view/bounds、registry/root shard or object hash as applicable. The
store rejects a token from another cluster/kind/scope or whose last key is outside the exact prefix. Resume starts at
`exclusiveLastKey + '\0'`. A page is strictly key-ordered；only a full `limit` page may carry a token, and an empty page
is final. Tokens are not serialized/durable；restart begins at the prefix, and concurrent insertion behind a cursor is
picked up by the mandatory later full pass.

`PhysicalObjectMetadataStore` and its exact methods are in document 05. Fake and production adapters share the same
record codecs and invariant validators. Fake behavior may inject conflicts/failures but may not relax key partition、
CAS or pagination semantics.

Every delete above is expected-version conditional and is reachable only from the retirement proofs in documents 04/
05. Missing-key success is accepted only after re-reading the exact identity for the same cleanup attempt；no public
unconditional task/index/checkpoint/stats/sequence/root deletion is exposed.
Retirement/audit code uses only the optional `get*` methods；calling a `getOrCreate*` method from a deletion path is a
source-audit failure because it could resurrect empty sequence/checkpoint/root metadata while proving a prefix empty.

The low-level client gains：

```java
CompletableFuture<Void> deleteIfVersion(
        String key, long expectedVersion, PartitionKey partitionKey);
```

Production Oxia maps bad version/missing key to a typed conditional failure；callers prove idempotence by re-reading.
Unconditional metadata delete is not exposed.

Generation-zero source retirement uses a separate focused adapter so the higher-generation store never pretends a
legacy/generic record is a `GenerationIndexRecord`：

```java
public sealed interface GenerationZeroMarkerIdentity
        permits LegacyCommittedSliceIdentity, GenericCommittedAppendIdentity { }

public record LegacyCommittedSliceIdentity(
        ObjectId objectId, String sliceId) implements GenerationZeroMarkerIdentity { }

public record GenericCommittedAppendIdentity(
        String commitId) implements GenerationZeroMarkerIdentity { }

public record VersionedGenerationZeroMarker(
        String key,
        StreamId streamId,
        GenerationZeroMarkerIdentity identity,
        long offsetStart,
        long offsetEnd,
        long commitVersion,
        long metadataVersion,
        Checksum durableValueSha256) { }

public interface SourceRetirementMetadataStore extends AutoCloseable {
    CompletableFuture<Optional<VersionedGenerationZeroMarker>> getCommittedMarker(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, GenerationZeroMarkerIdentity marker);

    CompletableFuture<Void> deleteGenerationZeroIndex(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, long offsetEnd,
            long expectedVersion, Checksum expectedDurableValueSha256);

    CompletableFuture<Void> deleteCommittedMarker(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, GenerationZeroMarkerIdentity marker,
            long expectedVersion, Checksum expectedDurableValueSha256);

    CompletableFuture<Void> deleteCommitNode(
            String cluster, StreamId streamId, String commitId,
            long expectedVersion, Checksum expectedDurableValueSha256);
}
```

Each delete rebuilds the key through `OxiaKeyspace`, re-reads/strictly decodes the existing L0 record, compares its
exact stored-envelope SHA-256 and then calls `deleteIfVersion` in the stream partition. Missing is idempotent only when the
same retirement plan already recorded that exact key/identity. The caller must hold/revalidate the recovery-root、
generation、activation and physical-root proof from document 05 before every batch；this adapter never infers safety
from age or a higher generation alone.

`getCommittedMarker` is the only planning read added here. It verifies the same key/value identity and returns the
captured durable version/digest；it never creates a missing marker. Generation-zero index and commit-node facts remain
captured from `GenerationMetadataStore` and `AppendRecoveryTailPage`, respectively, so the retirement package does
not duplicate those authorities.

The last Phase 1 object audit keys also use a focused adapter. They are not generation metadata and are removed only
while the exact `DELETED` physical root remains the coordinator described in document 05 §9.6：

```java
public record VersionedObjectManifestAudit(
        String key,
        ObjectManifestRecord value,
        long metadataVersion,
        Checksum durableValueSha256) { }

public record VersionedObjectReferencesAudit(
        String key,
        ObjectReferenceRecord value,
        long metadataVersion,
        Checksum durableValueSha256) { }

public interface ObjectAuditRetirementStore extends AutoCloseable {
    CompletableFuture<Optional<VersionedObjectManifestAudit>> getManifest(
            String cluster, ObjectId objectId);

    CompletableFuture<Optional<VersionedObjectReferencesAudit>> getReferences(
            String cluster, ObjectId objectId);

    CompletableFuture<Void> deleteReferences(
            String cluster, ObjectId objectId,
            long expectedVersion, Checksum expectedDurableValueSha256);

    CompletableFuture<Void> deleteManifest(
            String cluster, ObjectId objectId,
            long expectedVersion, Checksum expectedDurableValueSha256);
}
```

The wrappers retain the hydrated record for identity checks but `durableValueSha256` hashes the exact stored value
bytes before version hydration. The Oxia implementation rebuilds `objectReferencesKey` / `objectManifestKey`, strictly
decodes object id/key/checksum identity, compares version and SHA, and then calls partition-correct
`deleteIfVersion`. It exposes no list, create or unconditional delete. Missing is accepted only when the caller
re-proves the same `DELETED` root version and the same captured optional audit identity；the adapter itself never
turns absence into a GC proof.

## 5. `GenerationSequenceRecord` V1

```java
public record GenerationSequenceRecord(
        int schemaVersion,
        String streamId,
        int readViewId,
        long lastAllocatedGeneration,
        long allocationSequence,
        String lastPublicationId,
        long updatedAtMillis,
        long metadataVersion) { }

public record AllocatedGeneration(
        StreamId streamId,
        ReadView view,
        GenerationId generation,
        PublicationId publicationId,
        long allocationSequence,
        long sequenceMetadataVersion,
        Checksum sequenceValueSha256) { }
```

Invariants：

- `schemaVersion == 1`；
- empty initial record is `(lastAllocatedGeneration=0, allocationSequence=0, lastPublicationId="")`；
- every allocation increments both long fields by exactly one and stores the requesting `PublicationId`；
- replay with the same `PublicationId` returns the already allocated generation if it is the last allocation；
- allocation is not publication；the task must CAS the returned `(publicationId, generation)` before any index may
  be created；
- if an allocation response is lost and another task advances the counter before that pair reaches the task record,
  retry may burn another generation for the same publication id；only the pair that wins the task CAS is attached
  and every other number is a permanent, unpublishable gap；
- once a task records a generation, every caller reloads that task and never calls the allocator again for that
  publication；
- overflow fails permanently before CAS；generation never wraps or reuses；
- allocation gaps caused by cancelled tasks are valid and have no visibility meaning。

`allocateGeneration` loops read/validate/CAS under an operation deadline and bounded retry count. It does not hold a
worker lease and cannot publish bytes.
The returned value is accepted only when all identity fields match the request and the sequence wrapper re-read at
`sequenceMetadataVersion/sequenceValueSha256`. It is process-local proof, not a durable allocation record separate
from the sequence and task.

## 6. `GenerationIndexRecord` V1

### 6.1 Record

```java
public record GenerationIndexRecord(
        int schemaVersion,
        String streamId,
        int readViewId,
        long offsetStart,
        long offsetEnd,
        long generation,
        String publicationId,
        String taskId,
        GenerationLifecycle lifecycle,
        String sourceSetSha256,
        String policySha256,
        ReadTargetRecord readTarget,
        String targetIdentitySha256,
        String materializationPolicySha256,
        String payloadFormat,
        int sourceRecordCount,
        int outputRecordCount,
        int entryCount,
        long logicalBytes,
        long cumulativeSizeAtStart,
        long cumulativeSizeAtEnd,
        long firstCommitVersion,
        long lastCommitVersion,
        List<SchemaRef> schemaRefs,
        String projectionRef,
        long createdAtMillis,
        long committedAtMillis,
        String stateReason,
        long stateChangedAtMillis,
        long metadataVersion) { }

public enum GenerationLifecycle {
    PREPARED(1),
    COMMITTED(2),
    QUARANTINED(3),
    DRAINING(4),
    RETIRED(5),
    ABORTED(6)
}
```

Enum ids are encoded explicitly. `stateReason` is empty for `PREPARED/COMMITTED`, bounded to 4 KiB otherwise and is
diagnostic only.

### 6.2 Common invariants

- `schemaVersion == 1` and `generation >= 1`；generation zero never uses this record；
- record key recomputed from `(streamId, view, offsetEnd, generation)` exactly matches the stored key；
- range is non-empty, within the F4 maximum span and
  `sourceRecordCount == Math.toIntExact(offsetEnd - offsetStart)`；
- target is an `ObjectSliceReadTarget(version=1, STREAM_COMPACTED_OBJECT, ...)`；
- target/object root key、length、checksums and immutable object identity match；the generation record does not
  bind the mutable object lifecycle epoch；each reader lease captures the current epoch instead；
- source/policy/target identities are lowercase SHA-256；
- commit versions and cumulative sizes are positive, ordered and non-overflowing；
- projection ref is the canonical encoded `Optional<ProjectionRef>` string used by existing metadata；
- encoded `metadataVersion == 0` and hydrated version is non-negative。

For `COMMITTED` view：

```text
outputRecordCount == sourceRecordCount
payload/projection/schema identity == source identity
logicalBytes == sum exact source logicalBytes
cumulativeSizeAtEnd - cumulativeSizeAtStart == logicalBytes
physicalFormat == NEREUS_COMPACTED_PARQUET_V1
```

For `TOPIC_COMPACTED`：

```text
0 <= outputRecordCount <= sourceRecordCount
physicalFormat == NEREUS_TOPIC_COMPACTED_PARQUET_V1
projection/payload mapping remains declared but output uses sparse-view type
```

### 6.3 Lifecycle

```text
PREPARED -> COMMITTED
PREPARED -> ABORTED
COMMITTED -> QUARANTINED
COMMITTED -> DRAINING
QUARANTINED -> DRAINING
DRAINING -> RETIRED

ABORTED terminal
RETIRED terminal
```

All transitions preserve every immutable field, increment only the Oxia version and change lifecycle/timestamps/reason.
There is no `QUARANTINED -> COMMITTED` shortcut；repair publishes a new generation. `DRAINING` rejects new read pins，
but existing object leases protect already admitted IO. `RETIRED` remains an audit tombstone until conditional
metadata cleanup.

## 7. Other Stream Records

### 7.1 `MaterializationStreamRegistrationRecord`

```java
public record MaterializationStreamRegistrationRecord(
        int schemaVersion,
        String streamId,
        String projectionRef,
        String projectionIdentitySha256,
        String storageProfile,
        long registeredAtMillis,
        long lastHintCommitVersion,
        long updatedAtMillis,
        long metadataVersion) { }
```

The registry solves work discovery after topic unload、broker failover or process restart. It is deliberately not an
ownership or visibility record：a scanner uses it only to find a `StreamId`, then linearly reloads the projection、
storage profile、stream head、checkpoint and task prefix before deciding whether work exists.

Invariants and update rules：

- the key shard is recomputed from the canonical `streamId`; record/key mismatch is corrupt metadata；
- `projectionRef` is the canonical encoded non-empty `ProjectionRef` understood by the product activation guard；
  `projectionIdentitySha256` is the digest of the complete immutable topic-projection incarnation identity and
  `storageProfile` is a canonical `StorageProfile.name()`；all three are revalidated against the authoritative
  projection/stream metadata on every scan；
- first registration is create-if-absent before generation-protocol activation or async append admission；a lost
  create response is resolved by reading the same key and comparing the immutable identity；
- refresh preserves `registeredAtMillis` and identity, advances `lastHintCommitVersion` monotonically and changes the
  record only by version-CAS；the hint may lag arbitrarily and may never be used to skip a head/task scan；
- one stale registration cannot make deleted、fenced or incompatible projection state executable. The scanner skips
  it and emits a bounded diagnostic；conditional cleanup is allowed only with the domain-validated deletion proof
  defined in document 05；
- a live F4 projection or async stream without its matching registration is not activation-ready. Broker open repairs
  the registration before enabling the marker/profile and fails closed if repair does not complete；
- there is no global task queue. Round-robin scan of the 64 registry shards discovers the per-stream task prefix and
  also lets the planner recreate a missing task from authoritative committed head state.

`createOrVerifyStreamRegistration` is idempotent for the same projection ref/identity. Hint refresh uses
`compareAndSetStreamRegistration`；retirement uses `deleteStreamRegistration` and the proof in document 05. A
different identity at the same `StreamId` is an invariant conflict, not an overwrite. Registry watch events may
reduce latency but full paginated scans are mandatory.

### 7.2 `MaterializationCheckpointRecord`

```java
public record MaterializationCheckpointRecord(
        int schemaVersion,
        String streamId,
        String policyId,
        long policyVersion,
        String policySha256,
        long contiguousCoveredOffset,
        long observedCommitVersion,
        long lastTaskSequence,
        String lastTaskId,
        long updatedAtMillis,
        long metadataVersion) { }
```

It is a scheduling/lag optimization. A range is visible only through its index record, even if a checkpoint claims a
later offset. Recovery recomputes/checks it from committed generations and may move it backward only by replacing a
corrupt record through an explicit repair path；ordinary update is monotonic.

The key includes both encoded `policyId` and positive `policyVersion`; decode recomputes both from the record. A
semantic policy change therefore starts an independent checkpoint at current trim and cannot inherit the old
version's covered offset. Old-version checkpoints remain scan-visible for audit and are conditionally deleted only
after no non-terminal task/current projection policy refers to that exact `(id, version)` and metadata audit grace
has elapsed. `policySha256` is mandatory and must equal every task/index counted by the checkpoint；a low-63-bit
version collision at the same key is therefore an invariant conflict, never progress reuse. The version key is only
the checkpoint routing identity.

### 7.3 `RangeRetentionStatsRecord`

```java
public record RangeRetentionStatsRecord(
        int schemaVersion,
        String streamId,
        long offsetStart,
        long offsetEnd,
        long commitVersion,
        long cumulativeSizeAtStart,
        long cumulativeSizeAtEnd,
        long minPublishTimeMillis,
        long maxPublishTimeMillis,
        String sourceIndexKey,
        String sourceIndexIdentitySha256,
        long sourceIndexMetadataVersion,
        String verifierBuild,
        long verifiedAtMillis,
        long metadataVersion) { }
```

This record is derived for one logical append/commit-version boundary；`commitVersion` is unique in a stream and the
key's offset end must equal that commit's end. `sourceIndexKey` may name generation zero or any healthy lossless
generation that completely covers the record range. Candidate planning revalidates its key/identity/version；if
stale/missing, it reads and verifies source bytes or conservatively stops. Event time is never substituted for publish time. A corrupt stats
record can delay trim but cannot authorize an unsafe trim.

`createRangeRetentionStats` is create-or-compare for byte-identical facts. Replacement at the same
`(offsetEnd, commitVersion)` requires version-CAS after re-reading the exact source index and may only change source
key/identity/version、verified statistics/build/timestamp；range/commit/cumulative boundaries remain identical. Scan is
inclusive by offset-end and bounded exactly like generation scan. Removal follows document 04 and never advances a
retention candidate.

### 7.4 `RecoveryCheckpointRootRecord`

```java
public record RecoveryCheckpointReferenceRecord(
        long checkpointSequence,
        String checkpointAttemptId,
        long coveredStartOffset,
        long coveredEndOffset,
        long firstCommitVersion,
        long lastCommitVersion,
        long cumulativeSizeAtStart,
        long cumulativeSizeAtEnd,
        String firstCommitId,
        String lastCommitId,
        String sourceHeadCommitId,
        long sourceHeadCommitVersion,
        String projectionIdentitySha256,
        String objectId,
        String objectKey,
        String objectKeyHash,
        long objectLength,
        String storageCrc32c,
        String contentSha256,
        int commitEntryCount,
        int publicationCount) { }

public record RecoveryCheckpointRootRecord(
        int schemaVersion,
        String streamId,
        long checkpointSequence,
        long coveredStartOffset,
        long coveredEndOffset,
        long firstCommitVersion,
        long lastCommitVersion,
        long cumulativeSizeAtStart,
        long cumulativeSizeAtEnd,
        String firstCommitId,
        String lastCommitId,
        List<RecoveryCheckpointReferenceRecord> checkpoints,
        String checkpointSetSha256,
        String sourceHeadCommitId,
        long sourceHeadCommitVersion,
        long publishedAtMillis,
        long metadataVersion) { }
```

Empty bootstrap uses sequence/offset/version/size zero、empty ids/list/digest. Non-empty references are ordered by
covered offset/commit version, gap-free, non-overlapping and contain exact key/length/CRC32C/content-SHA/first-last
identity from NRC1. At most 32 references and 64 KiB encoded root are allowed.

Each reference recomputes `objectKeyHash` from `objectKey` and must exactly match the NRC1 header/footer、HEAD length/
checksums and object-key `(checkpointSequence, contentSha256, checkpointAttemptId)` components. Counts are positive
and within document 02 limits；attempt ids are random 128-bit lowercase base32 and have no sequence meaning. Nested
references have no independent `metadataVersion` or lifecycle；the enclosing root version owns their visibility.

Root coverage is a prefix whose start is the current logical trim checkpoint (genesis is logical trim offset zero). Any covered
commit must reference a committed lossless generation in NRC1. The root CAS is the point at which anchor-aware append
replay/index repair may stop consulting the replaced live commit nodes. It does not itself delete any key/object.

## 8. Task Record Summary

The exact task state machine is document 04. Durable shape：

```java
public record SourceGenerationRecord(
        int readViewId,
        long offsetStart,
        long offsetEnd,
        long generation,
        long commitVersion,
        String indexKey,
        long indexMetadataVersion,
        String indexRecordSha256,
        ReadTargetRecord readTarget,
        String targetIdentitySha256,
        String materializationPolicySha256,
        String payloadFormat,
        String projectionRef,
        int recordCount,
        int entryCount,
        long logicalBytes,
        List<SchemaRef> schemaRefs,
        long cumulativeSizeAtStart,
        long cumulativeSizeAtEnd) { }

public record MaterializationOutputRecord(
        String outputAttemptId,
        String objectId,
        String objectKey,
        String objectKeyHash,
        long objectLength,

        int sourceRecordCount,
        int outputRecordCount,
        int entryCount,
        long logicalBytes,
        List<SchemaRef> schemaRefs,
        long cumulativeSizeAtStart,
        long cumulativeSizeAtEnd,
        String sourceSetSha256,
        String projectionRef) { }

public record MaterializationPolicyRecord(
        String policyId,
        long policyVersion,
        int readViewId,
        int taskKindId,
        String targetPhysicalFormat,
        int minMergeSourceRanges,
        int maxSourceRanges,
        long maxRangeRecords,
        long targetObjectBytes,
        int targetRowGroupRecords,
        String compression,
        String topicStrategyId,
        long topicStrategyVersion,
        String topicKeyCodecId) { }

public record MaterializationTaskRecord(
        int schemaVersion,
        String taskId,
        long taskSequence,
        String streamId,
        int readViewId,
        int taskKindId,
        long offsetStart,
        long offsetEnd,
        List<SourceGenerationRecord> sources,
        String sourceSetSha256,
        String policyId,
        long policyVersion,
        String policySha256,
        MaterializationPolicyRecord policy,
        TaskLifecycle lifecycle,
        long attempt,
        Optional<WorkerClaimRecord> workerClaim,
        Optional<MaterializationOutputRecord> output,
        OptionalLong allocatedGeneration,
        String publicationId,
        int failureClassId,
        String failureMessage,
        long retryNotBeforeMillis,
        long createdAtMillis,
        long updatedAtMillis,
        long metadataVersion) { }
```

Sources/policy are immutable after create. The embedded policy is the recovery source of truth and must reproduce
the task's id/version/view/kind and canonical digest；current process configuration is not an input to recovery.
Worker claim、output、generation/publication and failure fields must match their lifecycle exactly. Failure message
is bounded and never used for retry classification；`failureClassId` is the closed machine field.

The task/policy `readViewId` is the target namespace. `SourceGenerationRecord.readViewId` must instead equal the
closed `TaskKind.sourceView()` rule；V1 requires `COMMITTED` for both task kinds. Thus a TOPIC task root has
`readViewId=TOPIC_COMPACTED` while every frozen source record has `readViewId=COMMITTED`. Codec/domain validation
rejects any other pairing. The two view-scoped sequence records may allocate the same numeric generation without
collision because every index key、task/output identity and publication check includes its view.

`PUBLISHING` deliberately freezes the publication id before allocating a generation. Its first durable value has a
non-empty `publicationId` and an empty `allocatedGeneration`；one same-state CAS may attach the first positive
generation, and `PUBLISHED` requires that exact pair. No other lifecycle may carry either field. This two-step shape
is required for allocation response-loss recovery and is frozen by record-validation、transition and golden tests.

`SourceGenerationRecord` is the field-for-field durable form of document 02's `SourceGeneration`；empty
`projectionRef`/`materializationPolicySha256` encode `Optional.empty()` and every non-empty value must decode
canonically. The policy digest is empty exactly for generation zero and mandatory/equal to the index for generation
greater than zero. Range/count/cumulative
invariants are checked before allocating collection/string bytes. Its index key/version/durable-value SHA and target
digest must reproduce the source union entry returned by the generation scan.

`MaterializationOutputRecord` is absent before `OUTPUT_READY`. Once present it is immutable and must reproduce the
verified object key/root/HEAD、complete `ReadTargetRecord` identity、task source digest、coverage/count/schema/
cumulative facts and view-specific format. `etag` may be empty only when the provider HEAD has no ETag；all SHA-256
fields are lowercase 64-hex and `storageCrc32c` is the canonical existing checksum encoding. For `COMMITTED`, source
and output record counts are equal and `cumulativeSizeAtEnd - cumulativeSizeAtStart == logicalBytes`. The task codec
caps sources at 128 and the entire enveloped task at 64 KiB before list allocation.

`createTask` compares the deterministic planning identity but deliberately ignores the caller-local
`createdAtMillis`; this makes same-task response-loss/concurrent-create recovery independent of broker clocks. Once
created, `createdAtMillis` is immutable and participates in every ordinary task CAS identity check together with the
embedded policy snapshot.

## 9. Binary Codec Contract

F4 records use existing `MetadataRecordEnvelope(NRM1, binary-v1)` and a new `F4MetadataCodecs` registry：

`F4Binary` follows `F3Binary`：big-endian numeric fields、strict UTF-8、length/count before bytes、canonical map/list
order、no trailing bytes and a 64 KiB payload limit. Booleans/optionals are one byte exactly `0/1`. Enum values are
unsigned short wire ids. `ReadTargetRecord` is embedded as length + exact existing target-codec bytes；it is decoded
through `ReadTargetCodecRegistry`, not Java serialization.

Each codec writes fields in record declaration order. Collection elements use their declared record field order.
Changing order/type/requiredness requires schema V2, new golden bytes and a rollout capability update.

`F4MetadataCodecs` is registered in `MetadataRecordCodecFactory` only after the generation capability code is present.
Old binaries see an unknown record type and fail closed；they never reinterpret it as generation zero.

## 10. Generation-zero Root and Protection Protocol

> Implementation status (2026-07-15)：the two-stage metadata API、production/fake proof validation、ordinary append
> and exact recovery sequencing、both permanent protection handshakes and production runtime wiring are implemented.
> Recovery-root retirement/GC consumers are outside this checkpoint and remain unavailable.

Phase 4 deletion cannot coexist safely with the former combined `commitStableAppend` call：that call created a
`StreamCommitTargetRecord` and advances the stream head without giving the object-lifecycle layer a cut at which to
protect the uploaded object. M4 therefore splits preparation from the existing head CAS and changes generation-zero
materialization to return the exact durable index identity：

```java
public record PreparedStableAppend(
        CommitAppendRequest request,
        String commitId,
        String commitKey,
        long commitMetadataVersion,
        Checksum commitRecordSha256,
        ObjectKeyHash objectKeyHash,
        boolean replayWasReachable) { }

public record ProtectedStableAppend(
        PreparedStableAppend prepared,
        PhysicalObjectIdentity object,
        ObjectProtectionIdentity protectionIdentity,
        long rootMetadataVersion,
        long rootLifecycleEpoch,
        long protectionMetadataVersion,
        Checksum protectionRecordSha256) { }

public record MaterializedGenerationZero(
        CommittedAppend committedAppend,
        String indexKey,
        long indexMetadataVersion,
        Checksum indexRecordSha256) { }

public record ProtectedGenerationZero(
        MaterializedGenerationZero materialized,
        ObjectProtectionIdentity protectionIdentity,
        long rootMetadataVersion,
        long rootLifecycleEpoch,
        long protectionMetadataVersion,
        Checksum protectionRecordSha256) { }

public interface StableAppendCommitter {
    CompletableFuture<PreparedStableAppend> prepare(CommitAppendRequest request);
    CompletableFuture<StableAppendResult> commit(ProtectedStableAppend append);
}

public interface GenerationZeroIndexMaterializer {
    CompletableFuture<MaterializedGenerationZero> materialize(
            ReachableCommittedAppend append);
}

public interface GenerationZeroPhysicalReferencePublisher {
    CompletableFuture<ProtectedStableAppend> protectBeforeHead(
            PreparedStableAppend append, Duration timeout);
    CompletableFuture<ProtectedGenerationZero> protectVisibleIndex(
            MaterializedGenerationZero append, Duration timeout);
}
```

The focused Oxia adapter replaces `commitStableAppend` with `prepareStableAppend` and
`commitPreparedStableAppend`. Prepare deterministically creates/reloads the exact generic commit-intent key but never
changes `StreamHeadRecord`; its result exposes the Oxia version and SHA-256 of the exact durable intent bytes.
`replayWasReachable` is only an optimization hint and is re-proved from head/recovery root. The raw prepared-head CAS
adapter is not exposed by `StreamStorage` and has exactly one production caller, `StableAppendCommitter.commit`；an
architecture test rejects another caller.

The append sequence is normative：

```text
0. validate the current fenced append session, process-run/sequence attempt and operation deadline;
   derive a never-reused WAL key and require its physical root absent or the same ACTIVE identity;
   before the first PUT and every provider retry, repeat the session/deadline/root check;
   then upload Object WAL, put/reload exact ObjectManifestRecord and validate ObjectStore HEAD
1. prepare stable append -> deterministic StreamCommitTargetRecord I, head unchanged
2. create/reload ACTIVE PhysicalObjectRootRecord from manifest + HEAD
3. acquire permanent REACHABLE_APPEND protection
     referenceId = "ra1-" + base32(SHA-256(streamId || commitId || objectKeyHash))
     owner = exact intent key/version/durable-value SHA
   then reread root and I; mint ProtectedStableAppend only if both are unchanged
4. commit(ProtectedStableAppend): reread protection/root/I, then perform existing
   fenced head CAS or exact replay proof
   -> STREAM HEAD CAS remains the logical append linearization point
5. WAL_DURABLE may acknowledge only after step 4 returned exact StableAppendResult
6. materialize/reload generation-zero index and return exact key/version/value SHA
7. acquire permanent VISIBLE_GENERATION protection
     referenceId = "vg0-" + base32(SHA-256(streamId || indexKey || indexRecordSha256))
     owner = exact generation-zero index key/version/value SHA
   then reread root/index/head
8. WAL_DURABLE_AND_INDEX_COMMITTED may acknowledge only after step 7
```

`REACHABLE_APPEND` is intentionally acquired before the intent is head-reachable. It never expires: if head CAS loses
or the process dies, the abandoned-intent reconciler may remove it only after `orphanGrace`, exact head/recovery-root
scan proves that commit id was never reachable, no generation-zero index cites the object and the intent version/SHA
is unchanged. If head CAS did succeed but its response was lost, reconciliation repairs/retains the protection.

A root in `MARKED/DELETING/DELETED/QUARANTINED`, an expired/lost append owner or any identity mismatch fails step 0
before bytes are sent. Retry then allocates a fresh WAL object attempt/sequence. Even after the old `DELETED` root is
audit-retired, the cross-validated tombstone grace is longer than every session/operation/recovery retry lifetime, so
an old process cannot treat root absence as permission to reuse the key.

The reachable protection remains while live commit replay may need the target. Generation-zero visibility adds the
second, index-owned protection before strict success. Recovery-checkpoint publication later replaces the live-commit
dependency; source retirement removes `REACHABLE_APPEND` only after the new root is re-proved. It may remove the
generation-zero `VISIBLE_GENERATION` protection only after that exact index is retired/deleted. Thus neither async
ack、index-repair lag nor commit-key retirement creates an unprotected interval.

Crash cuts：

| Cut | Head-visible? | Required recovery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| upload/manifest before intent | no | missing-root inventory or retry registers root；orphan grace applies |
| intent before root/protection | no | same deterministic prepare retries；no acknowledgement |
| protection before head CAS | no | retry CAS or abandoned-intent proof removes only after grace |
| head CAS before response | maybe | replay search proves exact commit；protection already vetoes GC |
| head committed before generation-zero index | yes | async ack is legal；registry/read repair materializes index |
| index written before visible protection | yes | reachable protection still vetoes GC；repair adds index protection |
| visible protection before strict response | yes | reload exact head/index/protection and return same append result |

## 11. Higher-generation Publication Protocol

### 11.1 Preconditions

Before publication, the committer holds：

- task root in `OUTPUT_READY` or idempotent `PUBLISHING`；
- exact output HEAD/format/content validation；
- source and output task protections created through the physical-root handshake；
- current stream head proving `coverage.end <= committedEndOffset` and source commit versions reachable through live
  chain/recovery root；
- source index identities still present and equal to the task snapshot；
- output projection/payload/count/coverage proof；
- a `GenerationActivationProof(GENERATION_PUBLISH, LiveProjectionSubject)` for the exact immutable projection
  identity and guard-captured current metadata version；
- no physical root in `MARKED/DELETING/DELETED/QUARANTINED`。

The source re-read is an admission conflict check, not an impossible cross-key atomic condition. If a source is
superseded immediately afterward, immutable logical bytes still make the output correct；task protections prevent
source deletion during worker/publish IO.

### 11.2 Algorithm

```text
publicationId = stable logical task-publication id

0. CAS task OUTPUT_READY -> PUBLISHING(publicationId, no G, exact output identity)
   -> idempotent recovery reloads the same PUBLISHING task

1. if PUBLISHING task has no attached G, allocateGeneration(stream, view, publicationId)
   -> unique G >= 1; retry returns the last allocation when applicable
   -> CAS exact (publicationId, G) into the PUBLISHING task
   -> response-loss/interleaving may burn unattached gaps; only the task-attached G proceeds

2. create VISIBLE_GENERATION protection on output object for publicationId/G,
   owned by the exact PUBLISHING task version/identity
   -> reread physical root and task; require both unchanged and root ACTIVE at captured epoch

3. reread task and require exact PUBLISHING(publicationId, G, output identity)
   putIfAbsent final index key K=(view, offsetEnd, G) with PREPARED record
   -> same publication/bytes: idempotent reuse
   -> different record at K: invariant failure

4. exact HEAD + compacted-format verification
5. reread task, stream head/recovery root, every source index and object root
6. require K is still PREPARED at version Vk and immutable fields equal
   revalidate the exact GenerationActivationProof

7. putIfVersion(K, identical record with lifecycle=COMMITTED,
                 committedAt/stateChangedAt=now, expectedVersion=Vk)
   -> PHYSICAL PUBLICATION LINEARIZATION

8. reread committed K and prove equality
   CAS-transfer the same VISIBLE_GENERATION protection owner from PUBLISHING task
   to exact COMMITTED K version/identity; reread root and K
9. CAS task PUBLISHING -> PUBLISHED(G, publicationId)
10. advance advisory checkpoint; remove task-output protection only after
    index-owned VISIBLE_GENERATION protection and COMMITTED K are re-proved
```

If step 7 conflicts, the committer reloads K：same `COMMITTED` publication is success；`PREPARED` same identity retries；
any other lifecycle/identity is reconciled through task recovery. It never allocates a replacement generation while
the first publication may already be committed without proving the first outcome.

### 11.3 Crash cuts

| Cut | Visible? | Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| output upload before task output CAS | no | deterministic task scanner attaches exact object or orphan GC later |
| generation allocation before PREPARED | no | gap is valid；task reuses recorded G/publication or allocates only after proving absent |
| visible protection before PREPARED | no | recovery removes protection after task/index proof |
| PREPARED before COMMITTED | no | verify and complete or CAS ABORTED |
| COMMITTED before protection owner transfer | yes | task-owned protection remains a veto；rebind to exact index |
| COMMITTED/protection rebound before task PUBLISHED | yes | task/checkpoint repair from authoritative index |
| task PUBLISHED before checkpoint | yes | checkpoint repair |

## 12. Committed Resolver Algorithm

### 12.1 Candidate scan

For requested offset `O`：

```java
static final long MAX_GENERATION_RANGE_RECORDS = 1_048_576L;
static final int GENERATION_SCAN_PAGE_SIZE = 512;
static final int MAX_GENERATION_CANDIDATES_PER_RESOLVE = 4_096;
```

```text
1. load StreamMetadataSnapshot H; require ACTIVE/SEALED and trim <= O < committedEnd
2. minEnd = Math.addExact(O, 1)
3. maxEnd = min(H.committedEndOffset, saturatingAdd(O, MAX_GENERATION_RANGE_RECORDS))
4. scan COMMITTED index keys whose offsetEnd is in the inclusive range [minEnd, maxEnd]
   using generationIndexScanToAfterEnd(maxEnd), page size GENERATION_SCAN_PAGE_SIZE;
   never compute maxEnd + 1
5. page until complete or MAX_GENERATION_CANDIDATES_PER_RESOLVE
6. hydrate legacy OffsetIndexRecord, generic OffsetIndexTargetRecord and F4 GenerationIndexRecord
7. retain entries with offsetStart <= O < offsetEnd
```

Here `saturatingAdd(a, b)` requires `a >= 0` and `b > 0` and returns `Long.MAX_VALUE` when
`a > Long.MAX_VALUE - b`; it never wraps.

For a projection carrying generation protocol 1, every new logical resolve performs this authoritative bounded range
scan. Higher-generation publication does not change `StreamHeadRecord`, so neither the existing positive
`OffsetIndexCache` nor a metadata watch can prove that no newer index exists. The cache may reuse strict-decoded
key/version/digest values and merge them with the fresh page, but it may not suppress the scan or add an entry absent
from the current authoritative result. Watch delivery only invalidates/warms sooner. A single already-pinned read may
continue to its target end as specified below；its next resolve scans again.

The hard maximum span from document 02 ensures a covering higher-generation range cannot end outside this bounded
scan. More than 4,096 candidates fails `METADATA_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`; the reader never silently ignores a possibly higher
generation. Planner/retirement metrics alert before this limit.

### 12.2 Ordering/filtering

Candidates are ordered by generation descending. Generation numbers are unique per stream/view；duplicate generation
records for one stream/view are corruption even if ranges differ. This deliberately trades generation-counter gaps
for a simple total order and unambiguous resolver.

“Highest” is a quiescent physical-selection rule, not a new logical-read linearization guarantee across a paginated
multi-key scan. If a higher index commits concurrently behind an already consumed continuation, this resolve may pin
a still-healthy lower lossless generation and the next resolve's mandatory fresh scan observes the new one. The bytes、
offset and projection are identical. Final index/root pin revalidation prevents use after that lower target begins
retirement. No task/checkpoint/cache is consulted to guess the concurrent publication outcome.

F4 candidates require：

- lifecycle `COMMITTED`；
- exact view `COMMITTED`；
- `lastCommitVersion <= H.commitVersion` and range within committed end；
- target identity and mapping compatible with the current stream/projection；
- registered exact target reader；
- current physical root `ACTIVE` with the exact immutable identity；the acquired reader lease binds its current
  lifecycle epoch。

Generation-zero candidates are implicit committed but still require their exact index key/value and physical root to
be pinnable. During rollout before physical-root backfill is complete, missing roots make GC disabled but reads use a
bootstrap pin path that creates/revalidates the root before IO.

### 12.3 Pin and final revalidation

For each candidate in order：

```text
acquire per-object/process durable reader lease
  -> reread physical root ACTIVE at lease epoch
  -> reread exact index key at selected metadata version/identity
  -> reread head/trim if cached snapshot age exceeds one operation
  -> require O is still readable and candidate still admitted
  -> return PinnedResolvedRange
```

If the root is `MARKED/DELETING/DELETED/QUARANTINED`, the index is `DRAINING/RETIRED/QUARANTINED`, the index
disappeared, or its identity changed, release
the lease and try the next same-view candidate. If the candidate came from any cache and pin/revalidation fails, first
discard the complete cached scope and perform one uncached authoritative scan；only an empty/failing fresh result may
return a typed unavailable/integrity failure.

One read may continue inside its selected lossless target until that target's end even if a newer overlapping target
starts later；bytes are identical and the pin protects this target. Every new resolve start chooses the highest
covering generation. GC retires an old target only when higher coverage contains its complete index range, so this
does not create a coverage hole.

### 12.4 Failure/fallback

- generation-record/range/projection invariant failure with healthy immutable object：best-effort CAS the exact
  index `COMMITTED -> QUARANTINED`, release, then resolve lower；
- physical object identity/storage checksum/format corruption：best-effort CAS the physical root
  `ACTIVE -> QUARANTINED`, then quarantine every discovered generation index for that object；response-loss repair
  scans the root reference domain；no automatic path makes the root active again；
- retriable throttling/timeout：retry within read deadline；physical fallback is allowed only after the configured
  same-view retry threshold and is metered；
- unsupported reader/format：fail closed and quarantine only after format metadata proves it is not a rolling-upgrade
  reader-availability issue；
- no fallback ever crosses to `TOPIC_COMPACTED`；
- generation-zero corruption with no higher healthy target is a stream data-integrity failure, not end-of-stream。

Fallback changes only the physical source. `ResolvedRange.offsetRange`、Pulsar Entry bytes and MessageId projection
remain identical.

## 13. Recovery-root Read Consistency

Head and recovery root are separate keys. Anchor-aware append replay/repair uses：

```text
read recovery root R1
read head H
walk live commit chain from H.lastCommitId
bridge exactly to R1.lastCommitId/coveredEnd/commitVersion/size
read and validate referenced NRC1 checkpoint(s)
read recovery root R2
require R2.metadataVersion == R1.metadataVersion
```

Head may append while this runs because the chain is append-only；a changed head causes a bounded restart only when the
requested proof was not already found. A changed recovery root always restarts, because old commit nodes may become
eligible for deletion immediately after the newer root is published.

Missing root means genesis-reachable legacy behavior. A non-empty root with a broken live-tail bridge/checkpoint is a
non-retriable invariant failure；the code does not fall back to assuming genesis.

## 14. Metadata Limits and Tests

Hard limits：

```text
metadata envelope payload                   64 KiB
source ranges per task                       128
checkpoint refs per recovery root             32
generation candidates per resolve          4,096
generation scan page                         512
task scan page                               256
retention stats scan page                   512
materialization registry shards               64
materialization registry scan page           256
physical-object root shards                   256
physical-object root scan page              1,000
physical protection/reader scan page       1,000
diagnostic reason bytes                     4 KiB
```

Required tests：

- exact key/golden envelope for every record and lifecycle；
- exact registry shard vectors、all-shard round-robin pagination、lost registration response and stale-hint tests；
- exact physical-root shard vectors、all-shard lifecycle pagination and root-only prefix isolation；
- registration-before-activation/async-admission tests and fail-closed missing/identity-mismatch behavior；
- reject enum ordinal/unknown id、non-canonical ordering、trailing bytes and non-zero encoded metadata version；
- concurrent generation allocation with gaps/replay/no duplicates；
- PREPARED invisibility and exactly one CAS publication point；
- source CAS conflict at every publication step；
- ordinary/topic namespace isolation and old-decoder fail-closed behavior；
- bounded candidate scan, overflow failure and highest-generation selection；
- anchor/head double-read under concurrent append/checkpoint advance；
- conditional metadata delete missing/version-conflict/idempotent recovery against fake and real Oxia；
- watch-loss tests proving all operations converge by linearizable reads。
