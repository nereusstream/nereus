# Future 3 Implementation Plan and Gates

## 1. Current Status

F3-M0 and F3-M0R are complete as design gates。F3-M1 is complete and final-gated：cursor metadata records、canonical
codecs、single-key store/core/Oxia adapter、F2 activation-marker preservation、cursor ack domain and immutable NCS1
snapshot codec/store all exist；unit/golden/contract tests plus real Oxia and LocalStack integrations pass。
F3-M2-M6 and the F3 Pulsar fork integration have not started。

A later milestone is complete only when：

1. every listed production target exists or an explicitly reviewed equivalent replaces it；
2. focused deterministic tests and cross-module tests pass；
3. the milestone Gradle gate exists and is green；
4. locked Pulsar source/member/call-path checks remain green；
5. authoritative docs are updated from “planned” to exact implemented behavior in the same commit。

## 2. F3-M0 Gate Record

### 2.1 Evidence performed

Against local Pulsar `master@7efae25af39a15407c1397d9e1f4ac4658d09daa`：

- exact source files and Git blobs in document 01 were inspected；
- `ManagedCursor`、`ManagedLedger`、`ManagedLedgerFactory`、`AsyncCallbacks` member surfaces were checked from source
  and existing compiled classes with `javap -public`；
- topic open/reconstruction、subscribe/open cursor、ack、dispatch/replay、reset/clear/skip/delete paths were traced；
- the executable cursor-internal property prefix and read-only analyze-backlog/duplicate-cursor path were traced；
- `AckSetState` and `ManagedCursorImpl` recovery/persistence behavior were inspected；
- Nereus F2 projection、facade、Oxia single-key CAS、ObjectStore and L0 trim contracts were inspected；
- no source or generated probe was added because the requested M0/M0R phase is design-only。

### 2.2 M0 questions

| Gate question | Decision | Implementation consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Durable cursors available synchronously at topic init? | yes, through `ledger.getCursors()` | ledger open hydrates all ACTIVE roots/snapshots before callback |
| Does openCursor receive subscription type? | no | subscription type remains broker policy; not in root |
| Is normal read position durable in stock recovery? | no | F3 persists no dispatch read position |
| Ack completion boundary? | cursor callback/future | success only after authoritative CAS |
| Batch ack coordinate? | Position extension, remaining-bit `long[]` | decode Entry for batch size; AND merge; no sub-offset |
| Can existing Oxia primitive atomically update multiple keys? | not assumed | one cursor correctness root; ordered retention protocol |
| Can current ObjectStore delete an orphan snapshot? | no | record orphan; F4 owns deletion |
| Does F3 require new L0 cursor API? | no | keep cursor in L1; reuse committed read/metadata/trim |
| Can broker housekeeping invoke L0 trim in F3? | no | `trimConsumedLedgersInBackground` stays no-op；F4 must use the coordinator |
| Can admin trim silently succeed through that no-op? | no | add/reject `TRIM_TOPIC` at the loaded-topic route in F3；F4 later admits it |
| Does live `getCursors()` include a later non-durable cursor? | yes, as locked stock behavior | open callback first exposes complete durable hydration；runtime registry may then include local non-durable facades |
| Can temporary non-durable cleanup touch durable metadata? | no | registry mode dispatch closes/removes it locally and never calls `CursorStorage.delete` |
| Can an old broker operation become visible after new-owner publication? | no | existing-root CAS is observed-before per-root claim or fenced；an already-pending CREATE/RECREATE target-key race cannot stale-finalize/callback and is recovered、claimed and rescanned before publication |
| Does broker open supply an ownership check? | yes | thread the exact supplier through checked writable open；require it before claim and final publication instead of dropping it as F2 does |

**M0 result：PASS。**

## 3. F3-M0R Narrow Design Gate

The original narrow question was：

> Do the F2/F3 protocol choices allow Future 3 and Future 4 to continue without overturning the compatibility model?

### 3.1 F2-to-F3/F4 decision matrix

| Review item | Locked answer | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `streamId + offset -> MessageId` stable? | F2 virtual ledger + `entryId=offset`; F3 never adds/remaps coordinates | pass |
| virtual ledger / entry / batch forward and reverse conversion unambiguous? | one Entry per offset; batch index remains payload/Position extension | pass |
| restart/failover/seek/history preserve MessageId? | same projection identity is hydrated before cursor; local read position is discarded | pass |
| projection becomes correctness owner? | no; it interprets F1 committed truth only | pass |
| metadata location/scale controlled? | F2 formula mapping; one root per cursor; ack holes spill to bounded snapshot | pass |
| F1 commit/fencing/visibility reused? | yes; cursor CAS is independent and cannot publish append bytes/head | pass |
| hidden compaction/GC invalidation? | closed by immutable snapshot refs, generation tombstones and recoverable protection/trim pending barriers | pass |

### 3.2 F3 protocol decision matrix

| Decision | Rejected alternative | Why locked now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| one `CursorStateRecord` CAS root | state/range/property keys | prevents partially published ack truth |
| local-only dispatch read offset | durable `readPositionOffset` | prevents failover skip of unacked delivery |
| generation + permanent tombstone | delete key and reuse generation | fences stale broker after recreate |
| full immutable snapshot + bounded root delta | mutable object or range truncation | root remains visibility owner; no lost ack |
| durable `ackStateEpoch` for destructive replacement | infer reset from generic mutation sequence/current ack shape | monotonic ack retries cannot reapply across reset/clear |
| per-writable-open owner session in retention + ACTIVE cursor roots | Pulsar ownership/watch or graceful drain alone | existing-root stale CAS is fenced；already-pending target races are recovered/claimed before the new dispatcher becomes visible |
| remaining-bit batch state + AND | deleted-bit ambiguity or batch sub-offset | matches locked Pulsar API |
| strict object/header/CRC/cap | best-effort decode/fallback | corruption cannot advance cursor |
| recoverable `PROTECTION_PENDING` before every create/backward cursor CAS | momentary version bump or periodic `min(markDelete)` | freezes the whole pre-cursor interval and closes missing-create/reset vs later floor-raise/trim race |
| `TRIM_PENDING` with exact offset/attempt/composed reason | fire-and-forget trim | uncertain/crash trim is replayable without changing audit identity and cannot unlock unsafe reset |
| live two-mode cursor registry + durable-only retention | permanently durable-only `getCursors()` | preserves stock enumeration without letting temporary cursors create roots/tombstones or retention references |
| monotonic topic-projection activation marker | capability signal alone | locked F2 decoder fails before exposing empty cursor state |
| separate cursor capability | infer from storage-binding capability | upgrade converges before per-topic activation；later downgrade fails closed |
| F4 physical GC consumes refs/trim truth | F3 deletes object on cursor callback | preserves read/ref safety and module ownership |

### 3.3 Deferred scope, not unresolved protocol

These are intentionally owned by later futures and do not block F3 implementation：

- F4 policy retention、materialization、compacted read and physical GC algorithms；
- F5 Kafka group metadata；
- F6 Lakehouse table/reference domain；
- F8 Key_Shared、transaction pending ack、replicated subscription、delayed delivery；
- performance tuning of defaults within the frozen hard/correctness limits。

There is no remaining unresolved item that changes F3 durable bytes、keyspace、coordinate semantics、callback
boundary、recovery or F4 handoff。

**M0R result：PASS。Future 3 may enter M1 implementation without a wider Nereus architecture re-review。**

## 4. F3-M1 — Metadata and Snapshot Foundation

### 4.1 Production targets

  records/CursorProtectionIntentRecord.java
  records/CursorRetentionRecord.java
  codec/F3MetadataCodecs.java
  codec/CursorStateRecordCodecV1.java
  codec/CursorRetentionRecordCodecV1.java

modify existing F2 projection compatibility path:
  ProjectionCreateRequest.java
  ManagedLedgerProjectionMetadataStore.java
  ProjectionMetadataStoreCore.java
  OxiaJavaManagedLedgerProjectionMetadataStore.java
  records/TopicProjectionRecord.java

modify explicit metadata registry dispatch:
  codec/MetadataRecordCodecFactory.java

nereus-managed-ledger/.../cursor/
  OffsetRange.java
  BatchAckState.java
  CursorAckState.java
  AckNormalizer.java
  AckWords.java

  CursorSnapshotCodecV1.java
  CursorSnapshotStore.java
  DefaultCursorSnapshotStore.java
  CursorSnapshotReference.java
  CursorSnapshotWriteRequest.java
  CursorRetentionView.java
  CursorStorageConfig.java
```

`F3MetadataCodecs` is an explicit fourth registry addition；record types are the exact Java simple names
`CursorStateRecord` / `CursorRetentionRecord`，and it must not use decoder probing or shadow F1/F1.5/F2 record
types。The snapshot store consumes existing generic ObjectStore APIs and adds no provider-specific S3 call。

### 4.2 Tests

Planned test classes：

```text
CursorKeyspaceTest
CursorStateRecordCodecTest
CursorRetentionRecordCodecTest
F3MetadataCodecsCompatibilityTest
CursorMetadataStoreContractTest
OxiaJavaCursorMetadataStoreIntegrationTest
CursorSnapshotCodecV1Test
CursorSnapshotStoreTest
```

Required cases are the complete codec/store list in document 03, plus：

- Phase 1/1.5/F2 golden bytes unchanged；
- unactivated topic projection retains exact F2 golden bytes；activated projection has a new golden and the locked F2
  decoder rejects its reserved marker；
- public property create/update/get cannot inject、remove or observe the internal activation marker；lifecycle and
  delete/recreate preserve it；
- codec/store goldens admit only the ACTIVE/no-pending owner-only retention shape when the projection remains
  unactivated，without changing the exact F2 projection golden；a cursor without marker/root and a marker-absent
  pending root fail strict validation。M2 owns the actual writable-open absent-create/claim state machine；
- fake and real Oxia return identical decoded values/condition failures；
- 32-way absent create and tombstone CAS races；
- page continuation at 0/1/255/256/max records；
- watch-disabled authoritative reads；M2 owns the two-scan open stabilization algorithm；
- snapshot ifAbsent collision；M2 owns upload-success/CAS-loss orphan observation at the root publication boundary；
- object identity/hash/generation mismatch at every header/reference field。
- `ackStateEpoch` field golden and decode invariants；M2 owns create/reset/clear/preserve/overflow transitions；
- owner-session field golden；M2 owns claim transitions that change only owner/sequence/updated time while preserving
  snapshot bytes；
- cursor and retention domain views carry the hydrated Oxia version while encoded metadataVersion remains exactly zero；
- retention ACTIVE/protection-pending/trim-pending binary goldens，including exact persisted composed-reason replay；
- codec goldens preserve negative/high-bit remaining words and the full signed position-property `long` domain；

### 4.3 Exit

```text
One key/version owns all cursor correctness fields.
Every metadata/object byte is canonical, bounded, checksummed and golden-tested.
A stable root reference hydrates exactly one full effective ack state.
No cursor state machine or Pulsar callback is implemented yet.
```

Implemented gates：`phase3M1Check` and the real Oxia/ObjectStore extension `phase3M1FinalCheck`。

### 4.4 Completion Evidence

Completed on 2026-07-14 against local Pulsar
`master@7efae25af39a15407c1397d9e1f4ac4658d09daa`：

```text
./gradlew phase3M1Check
./gradlew phase3M1FinalCheck --rerun-tasks
```

Both pass。The final gate reruns Phase 1/1.5/F2 prerequisites，the complete F3 metadata/managed-ledger/object-store
unit suites，real Oxia restart/range/watch/CAS parity，generic S3 integration and cursor-specific LocalStack
conditional-create collision plus provider-restart hydration。Real Oxia also exposed that range ordering is
hierarchical rather than flat Java string ordering；the production sentinels and fake comparator now match that
behavior。Only the typed `ObjectAlreadyExistsException` conditional-create result rotates a snapshot ID；other
non-retriable upload failures fail immediately while preserving the public `OBJECT_UPLOAD_FAILED` mapping。

## 5. F3-M2 — CursorStorage and Retention State Machines

### 5.1 Production targets

```text
nereus-managed-ledger/.../cursor/
  CursorStorage.java
  DefaultCursorStorage.java
  CursorProtocolActivationGuard.java
  CursorHandle.java
  CursorOpenRequest.java
  CursorAckRequest.java
  CursorResetRequest.java
  CursorMutationResult.java
  CursorMutationOutcome.java
  CursorStateMachine.java
  CursorStatePersistencePlanner.java
  CursorMutationLane.java
  CursorRetentionCoordinator.java
  DefaultCursorRetentionCoordinator.java
```

M2 is protocol-neutral with respect to Pulsar classes；test adapters construct offset/batch requests directly。

### 5.2 Tests

```text
CursorStateMachineTest
CursorStateMachinePropertyTest
CursorStorageOpenTest
CursorStorageAckTest
CursorStorageResetDeleteTest
CursorStorageSnapshotSpillTest
CursorStorageConcurrencyTest
CursorMutationLaneTest
CursorRetentionCoordinatorTest
CursorRetentionFailureInjectionTest
```

Required tests：

- every pure transition and invariant in document 04；
- first-activation-only guard invocation/no-production-bypass，activated recreate skips cluster snapshot，activation
  CAS conflict/idempotence and exact preactivation owner root -> marker -> PROTECTION_PENDING -> cursor attempt proof
  -> ACTIVE ordering；
- retention-first + bounded ACTIVE-root owner claim，full rescan stabilization，partial-claim crash recovery and stale
  owner fenced at every pre/post-CAS cut；
- unactivated empty-topic competing writable opens produce one claimed owner-only root；a delayed old-session first
  create may leave the monotonic marker activated but loses before PROTECTION_PENDING/cursor mutation after the new
  owner publishes；
- an old session that entered CREATE/RECREATE PROTECTION_PENDING before takeover may win the unclaimed target-key
  race after retention claim，but cannot stale-finalize/callback；the new owner reloads、claims/proves the winner and
  rescans before publication；
- randomized model comparison for range/partial normalization；
- 100-way same-name create, delete/recreate and stale-generation mutations；
- concurrent distinct-name creates enforce the exact record cap through the single protection slot；
- disjoint/same-offset two-client same-owner ack CAS races plus different-owner rejection；
- monotonic-ack response loss after CAS and `ALREADY_APPLIED` retry；forward reset/clear uncertain completion uses
  exact destructive-result/epoch proof or fails conflict；
- unchanged-epoch monotonic ack rebase versus reset/clear `ackStateEpoch` advance and mandatory conflict；
- root size just below/at/above snapshot threshold and hard max；
- snapshot replacement race and stable missing/corrupt failure；
- every failure cut before/after protection-pending CAS、cursor attempt CAS/finalize、trim-pending CAS and L0 trim，
  including byte-identical persisted composed-reason replay；
- cursorless requestTrim versus first cursor create shares activation marker/root and never calls L0 directly；
- a floor raise started after protection acquisition is blocked until attempt finalization；
- attempt proof remains through later ack/property/delete，and recovery never resurrects a delete winner；
- no test/model field for durable normal read position。

### 5.3 Exit

```text
CursorStorage implements durable create/ack/reset/property/delete with exact CAS semantics.
Retention floor plus protection/trim pending lifecycles survive every injected crash cut conservatively.
Oversize state fails before mutation and never truncates acknowledged ranges.
```

Planned gate：`phase3M2Check`；real Oxia/ObjectStore failure extension：`phase3M2FinalCheck`。

## 6. F3-M3 — ManagedLedger / ManagedCursor Facade

### 6.1 Production targets

Add/modify：

```text
NereusManagedCursor.java
NereusManagedCursorStats.java
NereusManagedLedger.java
NereusLedgerOpenResult.java
NereusWritableLedgerOpenResult.java
NereusManagedLedgerOwnershipGuard.java
NereusManagedLedgerOpenCoordinator.java
NereusManagedLedgerFactory.java
NereusManagedLedgerRuntime.java
NereusManagedLedgerFactoryConfig.java
ManagedLedgerModule.java
errors/ManagedLedgerErrorMapper.java

nereus-pulsar-adapter/.../
  NereusRuntimeConfiguration.java
  NereusRuntimeContext.java
  DefaultNereusRuntimeProvider.java
```

M3 maps exact locked Pulsar types/callbacks to M2 and upgrades non-durable cursor with the same in-memory ack model。

### 6.2 Method conformance tests

```text
NereusManagedCursorDurableTest
NereusManagedCursorBatchAckTest
NereusManagedCursorReadWaitReplayTest
NereusManagedCursorResetSeekTest
NereusManagedCursorPropertiesTest
NereusManagedCursorCallbackSafetyTest
NereusManagedLedgerCursorHydrationTest
NereusManagedLedgerCursorLifecycleTest
NereusManagedLedgerFactoryCursorOpenTest
ManagedCursorPublicSurfaceClassificationTest
NereusRuntimeConfigurationCursorTest
DefaultNereusRuntimeProviderCursorTest
```

The public-surface classification test inventories every locked `ManagedCursor` method and assigns one of：

```text
D = durable F3 implementation
L = broker-local/non-durable behavior
R = F1/F2 read resolver behavior
U = explicitly unsupported by owning future
```

No method may be unclassified。Tests also lock：

- exact `Position`/mark-delete/next-read roles；
- Entry/ByteBuf release on batch validation, skip, replay, cancellation and callback throw；
- callback exactly-once/executor/no-lock behavior；
- topic open fails before callback on one corrupt cursor；
- writable factory open returns only after owner claim/hydration，while get-only/read-only/storage-state inspection
  continues through the base `NereusLedgerOpenResult` and performs no cursor claim/write；
- the broker-supplied `mlOwnershipChecker` is no longer dropped：false/error/timeout before claim or final publication
  fails fenced，and first durable cursor creation checks it before and after the durable transition；trusted direct
  sync/no-checker overloads are explicit and never used by `BrokerService`；
- `NereusRuntimeContext` carries the real fail-closed cursor activation guard；the default provider wires it unchanged
  and cannot publish/activate before the fork capability coordinator has an attached broker registry；its F2
  source-compatibility constructor injects only the named fail-closed sentinel，never an allow-all fallback；
- the locked five-argument `NereusRuntimeConfiguration` source call compiles to frozen cursor defaults，while the
  canonical seven-argument constructor enforces every cursor/Oxia/ObjectStore cross-config relation；
- `getCursors()` is complete for hydrated durable roots before open callback，then includes later live non-durable
  facades like stock；`getActiveCursors()` covers both modes while slowest/retention remains durable-only；
- restart local read from first unacked, not previous dispatch position；
- clear/skip/reset/property/delete missing semantics；
- public durable open null normalization（InitialPosition -> Latest，property maps -> empty）before immutable request
  construction；
- position-property stage revision preserves a put/remove racing an in-flight ack/reset and close failure stays
  terminal without claiming persistence；
- position-property boolean compatibility：same-value put / absent-key remove still return accepted=true，but do not
  advance the internal stage revision；
- null explicit mark-delete property map reuses the visible staged map；only a non-null empty map clears it；
- null public `setCursorProperties` normalizes to empty external replacement while null keys/values still fail；
- duplicate non-durable cursor starts at mark-delete and copies whole/partial ack truth，not local dispatch position；
- analyze-backlog duplicate cleanup removes only the exact local non-durable instance；it creates no tombstone/count
  slot，and durable/non-durable same-name aliasing is rejected；
- `trimConsumedLedgersInBackground` remains no-op and `asyncTruncate` remains rejected throughout F3。

### 6.3 Exit

```text
The locked ManagedCursor surface has a code/test classification.
Durable cursor open is never ledger-local-only.
PersistentTopic can enumerate hydrated cursors without broker changes yet.
No deployable artifact combines the marker-aware decoder with the old F2 empty-cursor writable open.
```

Planned gate：`phase3M3Check` including the locked Pulsar composite API compile。

## 7. F3-M4 — Pulsar Broker Integration

### 7.1 Fork targets

Modify/add under `pulsar-broker/.../storage/nereus` and call sites：

```text
NereusTopicFeatureValidator.java
NereusAcknowledgeValidator.java
NereusAdminOperation.java
NereusBrokerCapabilityCoordinator.java (or focused Cursor capability coordinator)
NereusCursorProtocolCapability.java
NereusStorageBindingCapability.java (reserved-key composition/compatibility)
NereusBrokerStorageConfiguration.java
NereusManagedLedgerStorage.java
BrokerRegistryImpl.java
PersistentTopic.java
PersistentSubscription.java
Consumer.java
loaded and namespace admin call sites for the closed operation enum
```

The capability implementation may generalize the existing coordinator, but it must publish two independent reserved
properties and preserve the F2 binding protocol behavior。

### 7.2 Fork tests

```text
NereusTopicFeatureValidatorTest
NereusAcknowledgeValidatorTest
NereusCursorProtocolCapabilityTest
NereusBrokerStorageConfigurationCursorTest
NereusPersistentTopicCursorRecoveryTest
NereusPersistentSubscriptionAckTest
NereusConsumerAckOrderingTest
NereusAdminOperationTest
```

Required broker cases：

- durable/non-durable Exclusive/Failover/Shared admission；
- Key_Shared、transaction、replicated、read-compacted and delayed paths fail before mutation；
- cumulative/individual/partial batch and `requirePersistedAck` matrix；
- cursor failure leaves counters/redelivery/pending state unchanged；
- persisted success applies those effects exactly once；
- TTL/expiration/admin allowlist and F4 operations denylist；`TRIM_TOPIC` is rejected before the facade no-op，while
  periodic BrokerService housekeeping still completes normally；
- analyze-backlog validates the new closed enum member before duplication and scans the copied ack view；
- reset/clear/delete/recreate admin paths validate topic ownership and serialize dispatcher/read admission；a watch
  event alone never authorizes destructive handoff；
- retention/ACTIVE-root owner claim and cursor hydration occur before subscription recreation；
- capability spoof rejection、startup failure、two stable snapshots and downgrade failure；
- typed cursor broker-config mapping uses the seven-argument runtime configuration and the real canonical context；
  neither compatibility constructor can publish cursor capability；
- activation CAS success + retention-root/cursor-create failure/retry，and old-decoder fail-before-empty-cursor proof；

### 7.3 Exit

```text
The broker admits only the F3 subscription/ack/admin surface.
Client-visible ack success follows durable root CAS.
Every persistent broker must advertise cursor protocol 1 before first cursor creation.
BookKeeper-backed topics retain stock behavior.
```

Planned Nereus composite gate：`phase3M4Check`；Pulsar fork focused test selection is pinned by exact task names in the
implementation commit。

## 8. F3-M5 — Real Recovery and Retention Gates

M5 uses real Oxia、pinned LocalStack Community S3 `4.14.0` and two real Pulsar broker processes/services。BookKeeper
storage class remains present as a control path。

Required scenarios：

1. create durable Exclusive at Earliest/Latest, publish, cumulative ack, unload/reload；
2. Failover owner switch with delivered-but-unacked messages redelivered under identical MessageIds；
3. Shared disjoint individual ack from two consumers on one claimed owner，then broker failover/restart；exact holes remain；
4. partial batch ack, unload/failover/runtime restart, remaining indexes and MessageIdAdv coordinates stable；
5. ack CAS success + response loss, duplicate ack returns success exactly once；
6. snapshot threshold crossing, root delta, replacement snapshot and restart hydration；
7. missing/corrupt stable snapshot prevents topic open without state advancement；
8. delete/recreate increments generation; old broker/handle mutation rejected；
9. clear backlog concurrent with append leaves post-snapshot append visible；
10. backward reset/create races floor raise across every PROTECTION_PENDING cut and trim pending；no needed offset is
    trimmed，and post-barrier floor raise cannot reopen the old window；
11. crash before/after L0 trim with pending record; restart reissues/completes same offset；
12. TTL expiration and subscription expiration update/delete cursor but perform no unauthorized physical GC；
13. watch disabled: independent runtimes converge through authoritative get/poll；
14. 10,000-cursor/page-limit/count-limit behavior on an isolated scale fixture；
15. BookKeeper and Nereus topics/subscriptions coexist with no cross-class call。
16. delayed old-owner ack/forward-reset/protection CAS at unload/crash is injected before、during and after retention
    plus per-cursor claims；the new broker publishes only a fully claimed/stabilized view，and an old whole-ack cache
    cannot skip entries reopened by a destructive transition。The same gate starts from an unactivated empty topic and
    proves a pre-pending delayed old-owner first-create cannot enter PROTECTION_PENDING after the new owner-only root
    claim；when pending preceded takeover，its target-key winner is recovered/claimed and cannot stale-finalize or
    callback。Ownership-checker false/error at pre-claim、post-claim publication and first-create final callback emits no success。

Exit requires no orphan/reference leak to be mistaken for visible state；physical orphan deletion is not an F3 exit
condition and remains an observable F4 handoff。

Planned gate：`phase3M5Check`；Docker/real-service gate：`phase3M5FinalCheck`。

## 9. F3-M6 — Compatibility and Final Gate

Final scenarios extend M5（numbering continues after M5）：

17. save ordinary and middle-batch MessageIds, then unload、owner failover、process restart、seek/reset/history read；
    all forward/reverse coordinates remain identical；
18. ordinary reset normalizes a trimmed/future target to current trim/end；force-reset to the exact trimmed target
    fails before F4 compacted support and cannot resurrect bytes；
19. cursor property internal-prefix behavior across two brokers and restart；
20. root/snapshot limit exhaustion fails ack without silent truncation; `isCursorDataFullyPersistable` remains true for
    admitted states；
21. rolling capability sequence: the preactivation retention owner root does not alter the F2 projection；projection
    activation then precedes the first `CursorStateRecord`；the locked F2 decoder fails open on the marker after
    durable cursor exists without exposing/corrupting it；
22. L0 append committed/unknown/fence regression suites prove cursor work did not alter F1/F2 truth；
23. retained old snapshot/current snapshot/CAS-lost orphan inventory is sufficient for an F4 dry-run scanner to
    classify without deleting bytes；both retention pending lifecycles veto a newer deletion decision；
24. topic delete/recreate gives new F2 incarnation while old cursor roots cannot alias；
25. feature/admin bypass audit covers every loaded/unloaded/namespace route；
26. async cancellation/close/executor rejection produces exactly one callback and no ref-count leak。

Planned aggregate gates：

```text
./gradlew phase3Check
./gradlew phase3FinalCheck --rerun-tasks
```

They do not exist at M0R and must not be cited as passing until M1-M6 implementation adds them。

Final gate also reruns：

- Phase 1/1.5 final gates；
- Phase 2 `phase2FinalCheck`；
- root API/dependency/golden-byte checks；
- locked Pulsar source/member/call-path drift checks；
- Pulsar fork selected unit/integration suites；
- documentation status/link/terminology audit。

## 10. Documentation Gate

Every implementation milestone updates：

- this directory's status/evidence/file/method tables；
- `docs/design/nereus-future3-cursor-subscription.md`；
- `docs/design/nereus-futures.md` and design index；
- root/design README and overall architecture status；
- terminology when a durable term changes；
- F4 design if the handoff contract changes。

“Designed / M0R-passed” must not be changed to “Implemented” until M6 final gate。Partial milestones use exact
`M1 complete; M2+ pending` language。M1/M2 outputs are repository/test milestones and must not be published or
deployed as broker artifacts；the marker-aware decoder、M3 writable cursor runtime and M4 admission form one release
boundary。

## 11. Stop Conditions During Implementation

Implementation stops for a new narrow design review if any of these occurs：

- locked Pulsar method/call path changes semantics, not just source formatting；
- one-root record cannot fit mandatory identity/properties/reference within the hard metadata cap；
- protection intent cannot encode every admitted create or configured backward-reset target within its frozen cap；
- an ObjectStore provider cannot guarantee immutable ifAbsent + exact read/head/checksum behavior；
- L0 trim is found non-monotonic or non-idempotent at the same offset；
- broker ack counters cannot be reordered after persistence without a Pulsar-visible compatibility change；
- existing Oxia per-key CAS cannot implement retention-first + all-ACTIVE-root owner-session claim such that every
  old existing-root CAS is observed-before its per-key claim or loses，and every already-pending CREATE/RECREATE
  target race is recovered、claimed and stabilized before new-owner publication；
- F4 needs to remap logical offsets/MessageIds or make projection an append truth owner；
- any test requires silently dropping ack ranges/batch state to pass。

Performance variance、extra redelivery、conservative floor lag or orphan accumulation do not by themselves reopen the
protocol；they are implementation/operations work as long as bounds and correctness remain intact。

## 12. Phase 3 Completion Definition

Future 3 is complete only when：

```text
M1-M6 code and gates are green;
all supported durable subscription modes survive unload/failover/restart;
writable open claims retention + every ACTIVE cursor root before publication and stale owner sessions are fenced;
ack success has an authoritative one-root CAS proof;
MessageId coordinates remain stable;
no durable dispatch read position exists;
no ack truth is truncated;
destructive reset/clear advances ackStateEpoch and monotonic ack never rebases across it;
delete/recreate fences stale generations;
backward reset/create is frozen by recoverable PROTECTION_PENDING and cannot race past trim;
F4 receives explicit logical-trim offset/attempt/reason and snapshot-reference inputs;
docs describe the exact shipped implementation.
```
