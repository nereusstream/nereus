# Implementation Plan and Gates

## 1. Status discipline

This document contains the frozen plan and explicit implementation evidence. Current status：

```text
BK-M0 design/source audit       documentation-gated on 2026-07-19
BK-M1 provider-neutral foundation complete/final-gated on 2026-07-19
BK-M2 BOOKKEEPER_WAL_ONLY       implementation in progress (real-service storage checkpoint)
BK-M3 .. BK-M6                  not implemented
BK_ONLY module-local runtime    executable against real Oxia + BookKeeper; not registered by production broker
all broker BookKeeper profiles  reserved / rejected before primary IO
BookKeeper ledger deletion      implemented and real-service tested / production safe default closed
```

`bookKeeperPrimaryWalDocumentationCheck` remains the documentation gate. `bookKeeperPrimaryWalM1Check`、
`bookKeeperPrimaryWalM1FinalCheck` and the focused `bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2MetadataCheck` /
`bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2AllocatorCheck` / `bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2AppendReadCheck` /
`bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2RecoveryFencingCheck` / `bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2RuntimeCheck` /
`bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2RetentionCheck` / `bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2PulsarCheck` and
`bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2RealServiceCheck` are executable and backed by real
module/unit/Oxia/BookKeeper/predecessor dependencies；the unfinished M2 aggregate/final gates and M3–M6 names remain frozen target names and must
not be registered as empty/success-only Gradle tasks. A milestone becomes complete
only when its ordinary and final tasks execute their documented tests against the exact source locks.

## 2. Delivery dependency graph

```text
BK-M0 design gate
  -> BK-M1 provider-neutral foundation
  -> BK-M2 BOOKKEEPER_WAL_ONLY
  -> BK-M3 BOOKKEEPER_WAL_ASYNC_OBJECT
  -> BK-M4 BOOKKEEPER_WAL_SYNC_OBJECT
  -> BK-M5 Pulsar rollout
  -> BK-M6 compatibility / scale / chaos
  -> bookKeeperPrimaryWalFinalCheck
```

M2–M4 each include focused local-Pulsar tests. M5 closes full rollout/ownership and is not permission to postpone all
broker integration until the end.

## 3. BK-M0 — contract and local-source audit

### 3.1 Owned files

```text
docs/phase-bk-bookkeeper-primary-wal/README.md
docs/phase-bk-bookkeeper-primary-wal/01-current-contract-and-source-audit.md
docs/phase-bk-bookkeeper-primary-wal/02-domain-api-module-and-target-contract.md
docs/phase-bk-bookkeeper-primary-wal/03-oxia-metadata-ledger-lifecycle-and-codecs.md

docs/phase-bk-bookkeeper-primary-wal/08-scenario-evidence-matrix.md
scripts/check-bookkeeper-primary-wal-documentation.sh
```

### 3.2 Gate

```bash
./gradlew bookKeeperPrimaryWalDocumentationCheck
```

The gate verifies all documents/links、Nereus audit lock
`35c58c575c3da220633c53e48a581f16756ea047`、local Pulsar lock
`eaf7b9a704890a9265c21f30d9f351e02d00c600`、BookKeeper `4.18.0`、profile naming and explicit not-implemented status.
The exact command passed on 2026-07-19. It is BK-M0 design evidence only；BK-M1 completion is established separately
by its ordinary/final executable tasks, and M2–M6 may not be represented by empty Gradle tasks。

### 3.3 Mandatory review stop A

Before production code：confirm exact-id `CreateAdv` allocation、one-stream/session ledger ownership、provider-neutral
read result、range checksum、retention inventory、sync completion predicate and no-migration boundary. Any change to
those decisions updates docs/golden identifiers first.

## 4. BK-M1 — provider-neutral seam and adapter foundation

### 4.1 Module/build

Add：

```text
settings.gradle.kts                         include(":nereus-bookkeeper")
nereus-bookkeeper/build.gradle.kts
nereus-bookkeeper/src/main/java/com/nereusstream/bookkeeper/...
nereus-bookkeeper/src/test/java/...
nereus-bom                                 exported module version/dependency constraints
```

Boundary script：`scripts/check-bookkeeper-module-boundaries.sh`。It fails on BookKeeper/ManagedLedger imports from
`nereus-api`/`nereus-core` and on `org.apache.bookkeeper.mledger.*` anywhere in `nereus-bookkeeper`.

### 4.2 Provider-neutral API/core

Target changes：

| Area | Target files/types |
| --- | --- |
| generic read values | `ReadSourceRef`、`PhysicalReadStats`、`PhysicalReadResult`; simplify `ReadBatch` |
| compatibility | migrate `WalReadResult`/`WalSliceReadStats` and Object reader tests without logical/metric drift |
| registry | `ReadTargetReader` and `ReadTargetDispatcher` return generic results |
| read validation | `ReadCoordinator` compares canonical target identity; provider-neutral failure classification |
| append durable value | extend `DurablePrimaryAppend` with typed physical identity/evidence |
| append coordinator | select appender from `PrimaryWalRegistry`; remove Object prepared/durable casts |
| protection | `PrimaryPhysicalReferenceAdapterRegistry`; generic prepared stable append |
| completion | `AppendCompletionPolicy` + `AppendAckBoundary` + extended `StorageExecutionPlan` (all BK routes still closed) |

Compatibility constructors may live for one milestone but tests must use both native generic and legacy Object entry
points. No BK reader is allowed to construct a fake `ObjectId`/`EntryIndexRef`.

### 4.3 Metadata genericization

Refactor `PreparedStableAppend`、`ProtectedStableAppend`、`ProtectedGenerationZero` and
`DefaultGenerationZeroPhysicalReferencePublisher` to carry/dispatch `ReadTargetRecord` + exact physical-reference
identity. Keep `StreamCommitTargetRecord` bytes/golden contract and legacy Object dual-read unchanged.

Add failure-injection tests at：physical persist -> commit prepare -> protection -> head CAS -> gen0 publication. Object
profile behavior and current Phase 4 final gates are mandatory predecessors.

### 4.4 BookKeeper foundation classes

Implement without registering an executable profile：

```text
BookKeeperWalConfiguration + binding digest
BookKeeperLedgerGcConfiguration + activation/safe-default validation
BookKeeperLedgerIdNamespace + candidate generator/round-trip validation
BookKeeperLedgerIdNamespaceReservation value/codec/store + read-only runtime verifier
BookKeeperRangeChecksums (NBKR1)
BookKeeperPreparedPrimaryAppend
BookKeeperPrimaryPhysicalIdentity
BookKeeperClientOperations adapter over public 4.18.0 API
BookKeeperLedgerHandleCache
BookKeeper resource/deadline/error mapping utilities
BookKeeperEntryRangeReadTarget codec/golden regression
```

### 4.5 Gates

Target tasks：

```text
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM1Check
  -> API/codec/config/checksum/resource tests
  -> Object append/read/provider-neutral regression
  -> module-boundary/static contract scripts

bookKeeperPrimaryWalM1FinalCheck
  -> M1Check
  -> Phase 1.5 final predecessor
  -> Phase 4 final predecessor
  -> local Pulsar 4.18.0 API compile probe
```

### 4.6 Mandatory review stop B

Do not begin profile IO until Object-WAL passes unchanged through the new seams and a synthetic BK target can traverse
commit/gen0 metadata without Object fields. Review buffer lifetime、deadline propagation and public API compatibility.

### 4.7 Completed evidence (2026-07-19)

Implemented：module/BOM/catalog wiring；generic read source/result/stats and canonical target identity；generic physical
append identity/token and completion-policy values；BookKeeper configuration/GC safe default/namespace/reservation
verifier；NBKR1；prepared buffer ownership；4.18 public client operations；deadline/error mapping；bounded handle cache；
provider-neutral coordinator/registry selection；generic physical-reference proof/protection/gen0 dispatch；strict
provider-neutral read accounting；Object compatibility bridges；module-boundary and BK-02–BK-10 focused tests。

`bookKeeperPrimaryWalM1Check` passed before the aggregate. `bookKeeperPrimaryWalM1FinalCheck` then passed 199 tasks
(131 executed, 68 up-to-date) in 19m59s, including Phase 1.5、Phase 4 and pinned local Pulsar
`master@eaf7b9a704890a9265c21f30d9f351e02d00c600` final regressions。BK-M1 is complete；no BookKeeper profile is
executable until BK-M2/M3/M4 installs and gates its exact writer、reader、lifecycle、retention and completion runtime。

The current local Pulsar integration/source lock is
`master@41d1cddb9d29451884002b96de2bc52367cbb8ca`；it retains the BK-M1 historical evidence above and adds only the
focused BK-M2 borrowed-client boundary。

## 5. BK-M2 — `BOOKKEEPER_WAL_ONLY`

### 5.0 Current checkpoint evidence (2026-07-19)

Implemented：`BookKeeperKeyspace` and strict root/protection/reader/allocation-slot inverse；all seven V1 records with
explicit lifecycle wire ids、bounds and immutable metadata-version wrappers；seven binary-v1/envelope codecs and
`MetadataRecordCodecFactory` dispatch；focused writer/ledger store interfaces；production shared-Oxia and deterministic
fake adapters；protocol-edge transition validation；idempotent put-if-absent、exact-version CAS/delete plus
applied-response-loss reload；scope/page-size-bound `limit+1` pagination；all 256 root and 16 allocation-slot shard
coverage。Frozen envelope SHA-256、round-trip、malformed codec、store、fresh-store and failure-injection tests pass under
`:nereus-metadata-oxia:test` and `bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2MetadataCheck`。

The next runtime checkpoint implements `BookKeeperLedgerAllocator`、`BookKeeperWriterStateMachine`、
`BookKeeperLedgerRecovery`、`BookKeeperPrimaryWalAppender`、`BookKeeperPrimaryPhysicalReferenceAdapter`、
`BookKeeperReaderLeaseManager` and `BookKeeperPrimaryWalReader`。The exact provider path reserves an Oxia range before
ordered `WriteAdvHandle` entry ids；activates APPEND_RECOVERY on the durable reservation；binds REACHABLE_APPEND and
VISIBLE_GENERATION only to their generic commit/index owners；recovery-opens only to fence/seal；and uses fixed leases +
non-recovery open to verify the complete NBKR1 range before clipping。Focused fake-provider tests exercise success、
partial-write sealing、new-ledger retry、owner transfer、protection lifecycle、cold-handle read and checksum failure。
`bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2RuntimeCheck` runs these plus metadata/core regressions。

The retention checkpoint implements permanent `RETIRED` protection inventory tombstones、owner-specific
`BookKeeperProtectionRetirementProof` revalidation、bounded `BookKeeperWalRetentionGate` captures and
`BookKeeperLedgerRetentionManager`。`BookKeeperWalOnlyRetirementAuthority` and
`BookKeeperWalOnlyReferenceRetirementCoordinator` consume exact completed L0 trim or abandoned-reservation facts and
retire the bounded ledger inventory without choosing logical retention。The manager is a nonblocking convergence state
machine：double-capture
`SEALED -> MARKED`、drain/unmark、`MARKED -> DELETING`、exact authority/provider validation、delete response-loss
reload、first absence CAS、`lateCreateAuditGrace` and second absence before `DELETED`。Matching reappearance retries
under the same intent；foreign metadata quarantines。`bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2RetentionCheck` runs this checkpoint and
the metadata/runtime regressions；safe defaults still keep physical deletion disabled/dry-run。

Recovery also reconstructs missing mandatory fixed slots from the still-selected active reservation before clearing
writer state，and terminalizes non-durable RESERVED/WRITING attempts as exact `ABANDONED` authorities。

The profile checkpoint adds `BookKeeperStorageProfileResolver`、`BookKeeperGenerationZeroPhysicalReferencePublisher`
and `BookKeeperWalRuntime`。The generic L0 read resolver now delegates persisted-profile admission to the installed
profile resolver instead of hard-coding Object WAL。A full deterministic storage test drives strict BK_ONLY append、
exact head/protection proof revalidation、generation-zero publication and cold range read through
`DefaultStreamStorage`。The runtime closes only its appender/reader adapters and never closes a caller-owned BookKeeper
client。

The focused facade/Pulsar checkpoint now admits BK_ONLY through F2 projection/open/virtual Position mapping，drives
exact entry bytes through the module-local BK generation-zero runtime，and source-locks the broker handoff of the exact
stock BookKeeper client as a borrowed/non-closed context resource。`bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2PulsarCheck` publishes the
exact development artifacts，runs the ManagedLedger/adapter/module tests，then forces fresh broker Checkstyle and the
borrowed-client test against the clean pinned checkout。

The real-service checkpoint uses production `OxiaJavaClientMetadataStore` /
`OxiaJavaBookKeeperMetadataStore` and `DefaultBookKeeperClientOperations` against one real BookKeeper 4.18 bookie。It
forces exact CreateAdv response loss after physical creation and verifies recovery-open sealing、permanent slot/hazard
retention and a fresh candidate；it also delays physical creation until after the first absent probe, then uses the
bounded 16-shard `BookKeeperUncertainAllocationReconciler` exposed by `BookKeeperLedgerAllocator` to discover、
identity-check、recovery-seal and retain the late ledger；`BookKeeperUncertainAllocationRecoveryResult` reports the
complete bounded pass without turning absence into release authority。The
retention gate proves both `LATE_CREATE_HAZARD` and `ALLOCATION_SLOT_PRESENT` remain permanent vetoes。The same gate
also cold-reopens the real Oxia metadata service and scans exactly one root in every 256 root shards plus one durable
uncertainty slot in every 16 fixed allocation-slot shards。Focused deterministic allocation evidence now covers every
applied put-if-absent / CAS / delete response-loss occurrence、foreign collision without provider delete、two-stream
global candidate contention and randomized per-ledger entry/byte/range monotonicity；their matrix rows retain any
still-missing real-service level explicitly。The same gate
forces a two-range ledger rollover, closes and recreates both Oxia and BookKeeper clients, proves historical target and
byte stability, recovery-seals the cold active writer before allocating a new ledger, retires a completely trimmed
ledger, injects a successful provider delete with a lost response, then recreates the process again before the second
absence CAS reaches `DELETED`。The first run exposed that BookKeeper consumes the `ByteBuf` passed to `writeAsync`；the
adapter now transmits a retained duplicate and the SPI explicitly keeps caller ownership, with a focused ref-count test。

The current append/recovery checkpoint also closes BK-22 and BK-24 at the real-service level：one logical multi-entry
append is written as one exact consecutive advanced-ledger range and returned as one stable target；separate first、
middle and last write cuts recovery-open/close the tainted ledger, persist `ABANDONED`, and force the retry onto a new
ledger at entry zero。At the deterministic L0 boundary, a reachable head with a missing generation-zero index repairs
the same `BookKeeperEntryRangeReadTarget` without another provider write；future profiles and oversize batches reject
before any create/open/write call。`DEFERRED_SYNC` is not a configuration value to reject：the typed configuration has
no write-flag field and `DefaultBookKeeperClientOperations` always passes `EnumSet.noneOf(WriteFlag.class)`；the public
4.18 adapter contract test freezes both facts。

The real-service gate also closes BK-30：entry-count、exact physical payload byte、append-range-count and
`now >= createdAt + maxLedgerAge` boundaries are each evaluated before reservation；the triggering append remains one
whole range on the replacement ledger at entry zero, while logical offsets and cold reads remain dense across the
rollover。

The BK-M2 appender now enforces `maxWritesInFlight` before provider IO and binds decorated/fake provider writes to the
same remaining monotonic budget passed through allocation。Caller cancellation does not free the permit while an
ambiguous provider attempt is still running；the permit is released only after that pipeline succeeds or fails and its
seal/recovery path converges。Focused tests cover success、provider failure、timeout、cancel、capacity rejection and
runtime close；the existing prepared-buffer/client-adapter ref-count tests remain the byte-buffer ownership evidence。

Recovery now has deterministic applied-response-loss coverage for each writer/root CAS across
`ACTIVE -> SEALING -> SEALED -> IDLE`，including exact closed LAC/length reload。A real BookKeeper/Oxia test keeps the
old process and `WriteAdvHandle` live while a newer session recovery-opens the ledger；the stale owner then fails both
pre-head validation and an explicit advanced-ledger write, while the replacement range starts on a different ledger
at entry zero。Two process-run state machines also contend from the same observed writer version and only one recovery
owner/replacement ledger wins；the remaining independent-process contention cut stays open in the matrix。

The next deterministic recovery checkpoint introduces `BookKeeperAppendReservationIds` and
`BookKeeperAppendRecoveryCoordinator`。Reservation identity is now an O(1) function of stream + append attempt, not a
hash that requires the unknown ledger/range to locate。Focused crash cuts cover WRITING -> sealed/abandoned、same-session
DURABLE -> exact stable head/gen0 with zero provider rewrite、new-session DURABLE -> abandoned/sealed/retired plus a
fresh-ledger retry、prepared-intent response loss and reachable-head response loss followed by sealed-root gen0 repair。
The shared stable-proof validator admits a non-ACTIVE root only for an already-reachable replay and still reloads exact
root/protection bytes。Abandoned retirement now separates the durable abandoned authority from an already-ACTIVE
APPEND_RECOVERY protection's immutable original owner。

The real-service gate now repeats BK-26/BK-27 against production Oxia and BookKeeper 4.18 clients：a first runtime
persists a range without a generic commit and closes；a fresh client/runtime with the still-current session publishes
the identical target with zero BK writes, while an expired old session is replaced by a new owner that abandons/seals
the old range and allocates a different ledger at entry zero。This is real B/O restart evidence, not yet the abrupt
process-kill C cut。

Still required before BK-M2 is complete：close the remaining BK-M2 scenario/evidence rows and execute the ordinary /
aggregate final tasks against the current source locks。Production provider composition、first-create admission and
loaded/unloaded/two-broker ownership rollout are BK-M5 responsibilities, not hidden BK-M2 completion criteria；until
BK-M5, the broker profile remains rejected before primary IO。

### 5.1 Metadata/keyspace

Implement document 03 exactly：

```text
BookKeeperKeyspace + strict inverse
seven V1 writer/allocation/slot/root/reservation/protection/lease record codecs + wrappers/pages
BookKeeperWriterMetadataStore + production/fake adapters
BookKeeperLedgerMetadataStore + production/fake adapters
shared contract/failure-injection scenarios
all-256-shard root scanner
all-16-shard fixed allocation-slot scanner
```

No generic unbounded list/delete primitive is added. Golden codec changes require protocol/version review.

### 5.2 Physical module

Implement in this order：

1. `BookKeeperLedgerAllocator` reserved-namespace exact-id intent/durable-slot/root reservation/create/reconcile；
   `BookKeeperUncertainAllocationReconciler` scans all 16 fixed slot shards and seals/quarantines late creates；
2. `BookKeeperWriterStateMachine` allocation/active/reservation/recovering CAS；
3. `BookKeeperPrimaryWalAppender` explicit ordered writes and taint/seal；
4. `BookKeeperLedgerRecovery` recovery-open/fence/seal and nonterminal scan；
5. `BookKeeperPrimaryWalReader` lease/non-recovery exact read/checksum/accounting；
6. `BookKeeperWalReferenceManager` fixed range-protection + fixed reader-slot admission；
7. generation-zero trim/commit/protection retirement adapters；
8. `BookKeeperLedgerRetentionManager` dry-run, mark/drain/delete/dual-absence recovery；
9. `BookKeeperWalRuntime` lifecycle/composition。

### 5.3 Core/profile

Add `BookKeeperStorageProfileResolver` or extend the exact profile matrix so only BK_ONLY maps to
`BOOKKEEPER_ENTRY_RANGE + DISABLED + STABLE_HEAD` after writer/reader/recovery/metadata capability is complete.
Unsupported durability/completion policies fail before allocation.

### 5.4 Focused Pulsar slice

The implemented test-only/local composition drives `NereusManagedLedger.addEntry/readEntry` through exact BK
generation zero and proves virtual Position identity is independent of the physical ledger。The pinned Pulsar storage
provider extracts and passes the exact stock BK client through `NereusRuntimeContext`，with tests for identity and
fail-closed provider/null cases。Production-wide client consumption、first-create and capability rollout remain
disabled until the completed profile runtime is composed at M5。

### 5.5 Gates

```text
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2MetadataCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2AllocatorCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2AppendReadCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2RecoveryFencingCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2RetentionCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2PulsarCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2RealServiceCheck       real Oxia + real BK + restart/delete-response-loss checkpoint
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2Check                 ordinary aggregate, delete remains dry-run
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM2FinalCheck            real Oxia + real BK + restart/delete-response-loss
```

Final evidence includes empty/nonempty entry/physical-byte/append-range rollover、partial/uncertain writes、head/gen0
cuts、logical trim with mixed live ranges、fixed-slot protection/reader contention、foreign collision、permanent
late-create-hazard deletion veto and exact dual-absence delete recovery.

### 5.6 Mandatory review stop C

Before enabling physical delete：review complete protection inventory、root/stream/reservation scan bounds、foreign
custom-metadata check、exclusive exact-id namespace proof、validate-to-delete ABA、`CREATE_UNCERTAIN` nonterminal
handling、permanent `lateCreateHazard` veto and safe defaults. BK_ONLY must demonstrate bounded reclaim for normal
terminal creates；hazardous ledgers are an explicit bounded fail-closed quarantine, not a reclaim success. M3 cannot be
used to hide a BK_ONLY leak.

## 6. BK-M3 — `BOOKKEEPER_WAL_ASYNC_OBJECT`

### 6.1 F4 source adapters

Modify：

```text
DefaultExactSourceRangeReader
MaterializationTaskProtections
DefaultMaterializationTaskProtectionReconciler
DefaultMaterializationWorker
DefaultGenerationCommitter
DefaultTerminalWorkflowMetadataRetirer
source-retirement / reference-domain / generation fallback handlers
DefaultMaterializationLagSnapshotReader profile admission
```

Every switch is on registered target/provider identity. Output Object protocols/formats/codecs remain unchanged.

### 6.2 Async profile

Add：

```text
BookKeeperSealedLedgerMaterializationTrigger
BK source protection adapter
restart task/protection reconciliation
BK source release -> ledger-retention handoff
profile resolver plan: BOOKKEEPER_ENTRY_RANGE + ASYNCHRONOUS + STABLE_HEAD
```

The sealed-ledger/stream flush may create one-source normal F4 tasks. There is still one task store、worker pool、lag
reader and checkpoint truth.

### 6.3 Gates

```text
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM3ExactSourceCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM3ProtectionCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM3AsyncProfileCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM3LagCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM3SourceRetirementCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM3Check
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM3FinalCheck             real Oxia + BK + Object store, fresh-runtime cuts
```

Final gate proves stable-head ack before object generation、BK reads during lag、task reconstruction、NCP1 exact bytes、
higher-generation selection/fallback、source protection cuts、trim/replacement release and whole-ledger delete.

### 6.4 Mandatory review stop D

Audit for a second scheduler/lag/checkpoint/retention truth and for remaining Object casts. A task/checkpoint must never
authorize BK deletion without exact COMMITTED generation/read proof.

## 7. BK-M4 — `BOOKKEEPER_WAL_SYNC_OBJECT`

### 7.1 API/core/materialization

Implement：

```text
AppendOptions.completionPolicy + compatibility constructors
StorageExecutionPlan exact ack boundary
RequiredObjectGenerationRequest/Proof
RequiredObjectGenerationCoordinator
single-source deterministic task create/reuse/wait/recover
exact committed generation resolver/read-admission proof
append error/recoverAppend KNOWN_COMMITTED integration
```

Profile resolver refuses sync unless gen0/F4 worker/output reader/capability are installed. It refuses
`STABLE_HEAD`/`GENERATION_ZERO_INDEX` as weaker producer policies for a sync-profile stream.

### 7.2 Gates

```text
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM4CompletionPolicyCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM4TaskReuseCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM4KnownCommittedCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM4ReadAdmissionCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM4Check
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM4FinalCheck             process cuts around every task/publication/read/ack stage
```

Final gate proves no ack before exact Object read, logical visibility from BK while producer waits, timeout after head
returns KNOWN_COMMITTED, and recovery never allocates another BK range/offset.

### 7.3 Mandatory review stop E

Review public completion semantics and all error cuts. `WAL_DURABLE_AND_INDEX_COMMITTED` must still mean generation
zero; no code/test may equate it with Object publication for BK.

## 8. BK-M5 — Pulsar integration and rollout

### 8.1 Nereus repository

```text
NereusRuntimeContext borrowed BK client handle
NereusRuntimeConfiguration BookKeeperWalConfiguration
DefaultNereusRuntimeProvider shared registry/runtime composition
NereusManagedLedgerFactory profile-specific exact plan/admission
capability/activation core provider and status values
explicit namespace admin provisioning/revoke command and readiness/activation binding
```

### 8.2 Local Pulsar fork

```text
ServiceConfiguration BK fields/defaults/getters
NereusBrokerStorageConfiguration mapping/validation
NereusBookKeeperPrimaryWalCapability reserved properties
NereusBrokerCapabilityCoordinator profile readiness
NereusManagedLedgerStorage borrowed client wiring and close ownership
first-create/existing-profile admission
loaded/unloaded/partitioned admin/readiness routes
two-broker integration fixtures
```

The Nereus build source-lock checker must fail if any audited fork file/blob/API unexpectedly drifts until the design
and probe are reviewed.

### 8.3 Gates

```text
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM5ConfigurationCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM5CapabilityCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM5FirstCreateCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM5BorrowedClientCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM5AdminRoutingCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM5TwoBrokerCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM5Check
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM5FinalCheck             retry-disabled real two-broker acceptance
```

### 8.4 Mandatory review stop F

Production enablement requires exact broker readiness/config digest、immutable first-create profile、old-broker
exclusion、borrowed client close ownership and safe delete defaults. Online migration remains rejected.

## 9. BK-M6 — compatibility, scale, chaos, aggregate

### 9.1 Scale boundaries

Required exact fixtures：

- all 256 root shards from fresh empty continuations；
- all 16 allocation-slot shards with CLAIMED/CREATE_STARTED/CREATE_UNCERTAIN and lost-release occupants；
- 1,001 roots in one hot shard plus one in every other shard；
- maximum configured range x protection-slot Cartesian inventory across bounded pages；
- maximum fixed reader slots + occupied source-protection slots restart scan；
- 10,000 sealed/deleted roots without recursion/unbounded retained futures；
- 128-source/1,048,576-record F4 task with mixed BK/Object source targets；
- 4,096 generation candidates and 4,097 fail-closed boundary；
- configured concurrent streams/workers/deletes under one shared budget。
- configured maximum uncertain/hazard allocation slots rejects the next create without retiring/reusing any id or
  clearing any deletion veto。

### 9.2 Chaos/process cuts

Inject process loss/response loss at every numbered transition in documents 03–05, including late create after delete、
two allocators choosing the same candidate、two brokers fencing the same ledger、partial writes、head response loss、
task/source protection cuts、Object publication cuts and dual-absence root CAS loss.

### 9.3 Aggregate gates

```text
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM6ScenarioEvidenceCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM6ScaleCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM6ChaosCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM6CompatibilityCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM6Check
bookKeeperPrimaryWalM6FinalCheck

bookKeeperPrimaryWalCheck
bookKeeperPrimaryWalFinalCheck
```

Final aggregate depends on：BK M1–M6 ordinary/final、Phase 1/1.5/2/3/4 final predecessors、documentation/scenario
traceability、module/source-lock isolation、real Oxia/BookKeeper/Object/two-broker fixtures and clean rerun with no
up-to-date test shortcut.

## 10. Test source sets

Suggested bounded source sets：

```text
bkM1IntegrationTest       provider-neutral/API/local BK API probe
bkM2IntegrationTest       Oxia + BookKeeper WAL_ONLY
bkM3IntegrationTest       Oxia + BookKeeper + Object async
bkM4IntegrationTest       sync completion cuts
bkM5PulsarTest            locked local Pulsar focused tests
bkM5TwoBrokerTest         retry-disabled broker fixture
bkM6ScaleTest             high-cardinality deterministic/real metadata
bkM6ChaosTest             process/response-loss matrix
```

Docker-owning/nested-Pulsar tasks use the existing shared serialization service while ordinary unit tasks retain
parallelism. Each final task writes fresh reports and audits that expected test methods actually executed.

## 11. Error and observability test requirements

Every async public operation has tests for：success、validation failure before IO、provider failure、timeout、cancel、
close race、callback/metrics exception and response loss. Tests assert error code、retriability、`AppendOutcome`、attempt
id presence, resource/permit release and absence/presence of later stages.

Metrics tests verify profile labels and redaction; no payload/password/fencing token appears in logs、exceptions、
OpenTelemetry attributes or durable metadata.

## 12. Implementation stop conditions

Stop and return to design review if implementation discovers any need to：

- expose physical BK ledger/entry ids as F2 MessageId identity；
- make task/checkpoint/lag/projection a visibility or deletion authority；
- fake ObjectId/EntryIndexRef for BK；
- share one writable ledger among streams in V1；
- split one append batch across ledgers；
- use recovery-open for ordinary reads；
- ack after BK write but before reachable head；
- treat gen0 BK index as sync Object completion；
- delete a partially reclaimable ledger or a foreign custom-metadata identity；
- run a BK profile without the exact advanced-ledger-id namespace reservation, or treat repeated absence as proof an
  uncertain transmitted create can never appear；
- clear `lateCreateHazard` after matching metadata appears, or release its fixed slot without a separately versioned
  provider-operation fence；
- rely on listing/process cache for correctness；
- mutate profile in place or reinterpret pre-barrier commits。

## 13. Documentation update rule during implementation

Every implementation checkpoint updates this directory and current design index in the same commit：status、exact
files/classes、source locks、gate command/result、crash cuts and remaining exclusions. “Implemented” requires executable
