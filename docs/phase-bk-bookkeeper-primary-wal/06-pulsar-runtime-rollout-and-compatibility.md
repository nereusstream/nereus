# Pulsar Runtime, Rollout, and Compatibility

## 1. Local source boundary

The integration target is the local Pulsar checkout only：

```text
/Users/liusinan/apps/ideaproject/nereusstream/pulsar
master@3d103e6a0e1607dfd95245994cea87375ca62c5c
BookKeeper 4.18.0
```

There is no `M1-SNAPSHOT` dependency. Nereus Gradle gates compile/check the local fork through the existing locked
checkout mechanism.

## 2. Borrowed BookKeeper client ownership

Current `NereusManagedLedgerStorage` creates a `ManagedLedgerClientFactory`, obtains the default stock storage class,
and closes that owner at broker shutdown. The focused BK-M2 wiring now performs：

```java
ManagedLedgerStorageClass raw = localBookkeeper.getDefaultStorageClass();
BookkeeperManagedLedgerStorageClass stock =
    (BookkeeperManagedLedgerStorageClass) raw;
org.apache.bookkeeper.client.api.BookKeeper borrowed =
    stock.getBookKeeperClient();

NereusRuntimeContext context = new NereusRuntimeContext(
    ...,
    Optional.of(borrowed),
    capabilityCoordinator, // BookKeeperBrokerReadinessProvider
    capabilityCoordinator::installBookKeeperPrimaryWalCapability);
```

Exact type/wrapper names may follow module conventions. Required ownership：

- `ManagedLedgerClientFactory` is the sole owner/closer；
- Nereus may create/close ledger/read/write handles obtained from the client；
- Nereus never calls `BookKeeper.close()` and never closes broker event loops；
- partial Nereus runtime initialization closes only Nereus-owned resources, then the existing storage error path closes
  the stock factory once；
- the same broker capability coordinator receives the stable publication binding before storage initialization and
  provides live two-snapshot BK deletion readiness after registry attachment；it never transfers client ownership；
- `NereusManagedLedgerStorageBookKeeperClientTest` freezes exact instance identity plus non-BK/null rejection；the
  normal/partial-close ownership counts remain required through the production BK runtime rollout。

`nereus-api`/`nereus-core` do not import Pulsar or ManagedLedger classes. `nereus-bookkeeper` depends on BookKeeper
client API, while `nereus-pulsar-adapter` is the composition boundary.

BK-M5 checkpoints B–D now consume `borrowedBookKeeperClient` through `DefaultBookKeeperClientOperations` and install
the completed M2-M4 runtime without ever closing the client。Before advertising capability，bootstrap performs a
bounded read of the separately provisioned Oxia namespace record、validates its exact deployment/config binding and
probes the password secret reference，then reads the binding-specific activation record。An absent/PREPARED activation
keeps the runtime available for existing-target reads but publishes no BK first-create capability；partial
initialization still closes only Nereus-owned adapters/metadata views。

## 3. Runtime composition

Refactor the Object-named composition seam only as far as needed：

```text
DefaultNereusRuntimeProvider
  -> shared Oxia / ObjectStore / F2-F4 runtime
  -> Object primary-WAL adapter (existing profiles)
  -> BookKeeperWalRuntime (when BK capability/config installed)
       appender + reader + allocator + recovery + retention
  -> PrimaryWalRegistry(Object + BK)
  -> provider-neutral AppendCoordinator / ReadTargetReaderRegistry
  -> one shared F4 planner/task/worker/checkpoint/lag runtime
```

Do not instantiate a second F4 service for BK profiles. Materialization registry scans all registered object-enabled
streams and dispatches each source target through the generic registry.

Runtime startup order：metadata/object provider -> BK borrowed adapter/config validation -> registries -> append/read
core -> managed-ledger factory -> recovery scanners -> optional workers -> optional safe GC. Close runs in reverse and
is bounded.

Implemented checkpoint B/C composition uses one `PrimaryWalRegistry.combine(Object, BK)` and passes the BK physical
reference adapter into generation-zero publication plus the BK materialization-source provider into the existing F4
runtime。No second planner、worker pool or lag authority is created。Checkpoint D adds the durable activation control
plane and read-side admission；checkpoint E adds the one binding-filtered all-shard retention loop under explicit
non-dry-run configuration。Deletion remains fail closed until the separate coverage/scope proof producers activate its
durable authority。

## 4. Broker configuration

Add checked one-time fields to `ServiceConfiguration` and map them in `NereusBrokerStorageConfiguration`：

| Field | V1 rule/default |
| --- | --- |
| `nereusBookKeeperPrimaryWalEnabled` | `false`; gates registration/profile first-create |
| `nereusBookKeeperClusterAlias` | nonblank durable alias |
| `nereusBookKeeperProviderScopeId` | required canonical non-secret stock BK metadata-service/ledger-root identity；adapter derives/verifies SHA-256 |
| `nereusBookKeeperLedgerIdPrefixBits` | required `[8,24]`；leaves at least 39 random bits inside positive 63-bit ids |
| `nereusBookKeeperLedgerIdPrefixValue` | required canonical value with highest prefix bit one；all generated/existing ids must round-trip it |
| `nereusBookKeeperLedgerIdNamespaceReservationId` | required deployment-owned reservation identity；immutable/digest-bound, not a Boolean override |
| `nereusBookKeeperEnsembleSize` | positive; defaults to explicit stock BK configured value |
| `nereusBookKeeperWriteQuorumSize` | `ensemble >= write >= ack` |
| `nereusBookKeeperAckQuorumSize` | positive |
| `nereusBookKeeperDigestType` | admitted BookKeeper digest enum; immutable binding |
| `nereusBookKeeperPasswordSecretRef` | secret reference only; empty password must be explicit/defaulted consistently |
| `nereusBookKeeperMaxEntriesPerLedger` | positive and bounded |
| `nereusBookKeeperMaxBytesPerLedger` | positive and bounded |
| `nereusBookKeeperMaxAppendRangesPerLedger` | positive hard bound for protection/inventory pagination |
| `nereusBookKeeperProtectionSlotsPerRange` | `[4,64]` fixed slots；checked product with max ranges is at most 65,536 |
| `nereusBookKeeperMaxReaderLeasesPerLedger` | positive hard cap on process/ledger lease rows；overflow rejects read before provider IO |
| `nereusBookKeeperMaxUncertainAllocations` | `[1,65536]` fixed durable slot count；exhaustion rejects before another provider create |
| `nereusBookKeeperMaxLedgerAgeSeconds` | positive |
| `nereusBookKeeperMaxWritesInFlight` | V1 default `1`; bounded |
| `nereusBookKeeperMaxReadsInFlight` | positive |
| `nereusBookKeeperMaxReadBytesInFlight` | at least one admitted target bound |
| `nereusBookKeeperOperationTimeoutSeconds` | positive, within broker close budget |
| `nereusBookKeeperAllocationTimeoutSeconds` | positive |
| `nereusBookKeeperSealTimeoutSeconds` | positive |
| `nereusBookKeeperDeleteTimeoutSeconds` | positive |
| `nereusBookKeeperReaderLeaseSeconds` | greater than renewal interval |
| `nereusBookKeeperReaderLeaseRenewSeconds` | positive |
| `nereusBookKeeperRetentionScanIntervalSeconds` | positive |
| `nereusBookKeeperRetentionScanPageSize` | `[1,1024]` |
| `nereusBookKeeperMaxConcurrentDeletes` | positive bounded |
| `nereusBookKeeperMaxClockSkewSeconds` | nonnegative deployment bound；part of lease/drain safety validation |
| `nereusBookKeeperGcDrainGraceSeconds` | at least reader lease + clock skew |
| `nereusBookKeeperLateCreateAuditGraceSeconds` | positive alert/recheck pacing only；never proves a transmitted create impossible |
| `nereusBookKeeperGcEnabled` | `false` safe default |
| `nereusBookKeeperGcDryRun` | `true` safe default |

The provider/ledger/read/scan fields map to `BookKeeperWalConfiguration`; delete concurrency、clock/drain/audit and
the two local switches map to `BookKeeperLedgerGcConfiguration`。No field is silently dropped or defaulted differently
between brokers.

`nereusDefaultStorageProfile` remains first-create-only. Merely selecting a BK enum while the feature/capability is
disabled must fail broker config validation or topic first-create before any ledger allocation.

Configuration binding SHA-256 includes cluster alias、provider-scope digest、exact ledger-id namespace/reservation、quorums、digest、range/
size bounds、non-secret password identity/version and V1 protocol semantics. Every broker advertises the same digest;
secret bytes never enter lookup properties/Oxia/logs.

### 4.1 Namespace provisioning authority

Runtime code must not turn a config string into its own exclusivity proof. A separate, explicit cluster provisioning
operation creates one immutable/revocable record under the product capability keyspace：

```text
${globalNereusPrefix}/bookkeeper-provider-scopes/v1/${providerScopeSha256}/ledger-id-prefixes/${prefixBits:02d}/${prefixValue:06x}
```

Every Nereus deployment sharing that BookKeeper provider scope must use the same Oxia authority/global prefix；if it
cannot, shared-scope BK profiles are unsupported. Components are canonical and strict-inverse parsed.
`providerScopeSha256` is 64 lowercase hex、prefix bits are two decimal digits and prefix value is six lowercase hex
digits with leading zeroes；decode/re-encode equality is mandatory.

```java
record BookKeeperLedgerIdNamespaceReservationRecord(
    int schemaVersion,
    String reservationId,
    String nereusDeploymentId,
    String clusterAlias,
    String bookKeeperProviderScopeSha256,
    int ledgerIdPrefixBits,
    long ledgerIdPrefixValue,
    Lifecycle lifecycle,                 // ACTIVE, REVOKED
    long reservationEpoch,
    long createdAtMillis,
    long revokedAtMillis,
    String operatorEvidenceSha256,
    long metadataVersion) { }
```

Lifecycle wire ids are `ACTIVE=1` and `REVOKED=2`；ordinals are forbidden. `reservationEpoch` is one at creation and
increments only for the terminal revoke CAS.

`ledgerIdNamespaceSha256` uses the exact binary frame
`SHA-256("NBLN1" || u32be(keyUtf8Length) || keyUtf8 || i64be(Oxia metadata version) ||
decodeLowerHex32(storedValueSha256))`。That exact digest is written into broker readiness、stream config binding、ledger
root/custom metadata and activation；a revoke or record replacement cannot retain the old capability identity.

The admin operation verifies the BookKeeper scope and deployment policy, uses put-if-absent/CAS to prevent two Nereus
deployments reserving the same `(providerScope,prefix)`, and records non-secret evidence digest only. Brokers may only
read/verify this record；startup, first-create and activation never auto-create it. `REVOKED` is terminal and invalidates
readiness immediately. This coordinates trusted Nereus deployments；a BookKeeper environment permitting untrusted
external exact `CreateAdv` in the prefix is outside the supported profile, because the provider cannot enforce a
conditional delete fence.

BK-M5 checkpoint D implements this boundary as two deliberately different surfaces：

- `BookKeeperLedgerIdNamespaceReservationStore` remains read-only and is the only interface received by broker WAL
  bootstrap；
- `BookKeeperLedgerIdNamespaceReservationAdminStore` adds exact put-if-absent/version-CAS only for
  `BookKeeperLedgerIdNamespaceProvisioningCoordinator`；
- `BookKeeperPrimaryWalAdministration.provisionNamespace/revokeNamespace` is the explicit embedding surface for a
  broker/admin route；normal runtime never calls it；
- provision is idempotent only for the same ACTIVE epoch-one identity and operator evidence digest；any foreign or
  terminal record fails closed；revoke requires the observed Oxia version、increments the reservation epoch exactly
  once and cannot be reversed；
- both create and revoke recover an applied-but-response-lost write only when a reload contains the byte-identical
  desired `NBLR1` value at a newer valid version。

## 5. Cluster capability

Add reserved lookup properties：

```text
nereus.bookkeeper-primary-wal-protocol = "1"
nereus.bookkeeper-primary-wal-config   = <configuration binding SHA-256>
nereus.bookkeeper-ledger-namespace     = <reserved-prefix + reservation binding SHA-256>
nereus.bookkeeper-primary-wal-activation = <stable NBKAP1 publication binding SHA-256>
nereus.bookkeeper-required-object-generation = "1"
```

`NereusBookKeeperPrimaryWalCapability.requireUnreserved` chains with existing storage-binding/cursor/generation
reserved checks. `NereusBrokerCapabilityCoordinator.decorateLookupProperties` publishes them only after the borrowed
client、module、codecs、writer/reader/recovery and exact deployment namespace reservation are initialized.

Profile barriers use two stable all-persistent-broker snapshots：

| Profile | Required capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| BK_ONLY | storage binding + cursor + BK protocol/config + exact ledger-id namespace |
| BK_ASYNC_OBJECT | BK_ONLY set + generation protocol |
| BK_SYNC_OBJECT | BK_ONLY set + generation protocol + independent required-object completion property |

BK-M4 has final-gated the module-local completion path；the production rollout nevertheless keeps sync completion as a
separate reserved property so a broker cannot infer Object publication support from generation-zero durability。The
implemented first-create barrier verifies the complete profile-specific property set in one stable two-snapshot fact，
not by composing independent readiness checks from different broker epochs。

Readiness identity includes broker id、start timestamp、all required property key/values and configuration digest.
Registry changes invalidate cached readiness. A broker with missing/different config keeps new BK profile admission
closed; existing topics may read only if the broker can satisfy their exact durable profile, otherwise ownership must
not be assigned/opened there.

Deletion activation also requires `maxReaderLeasesPerLedger` to cover the stable persistent-broker set plus one
conservative rolling-restart overlap slot in V1. A larger broker set invalidates deletion readiness；the limit cannot
be silently exceeded and later used as a truncated GC scan. This capacity check is performed again from live broker
readiness on every physical-deletion gate, not trusted from operator-supplied activation bytes.

## 6. Durable activation and deletion gate

Add a product-owned `BookKeeperProtocolActivationRecord` under a binding-specific Oxia capability key：

```text
/nereus/bookkeeper-primary-wal/v1/clusters/{sha256(clusterAlias)}/bindings/
  {configurationBindingSha256}/{ledgerIdNamespaceSha256}/activation
```

The activation key includes the physical configuration and the exact `NBLN1` namespace identity. A terminal namespace
revoke therefore cannot be overwritten in place or accidentally authorize a replacement prefix；a new binding receives
a new activation key while old streams keep their original target/reader contract. The partition identity is
`bookkeeper-primary-wal-v1-{sha256(clusterAlias)}`。

```java
record BookKeeperProtocolActivationRecord(
    int schemaVersion,
    Lifecycle lifecycle,                 // PREPARED, ACTIVE
    int protocolVersion,
    String clusterAlias,
    String providerScopeSha256,
    long brokerReadinessEpoch,
    String brokerReadinessSha256,
    String configurationBindingSha256,
    String ledgerIdNamespaceSha256,
    boolean walOnlyPublicationEnabled,
    boolean asyncPublicationEnabled,
    boolean syncPublicationEnabled,
    boolean ledgerDeletionEnabled,
    String rootCoverageProofSha256,
    String streamCoverageProofSha256,
    String bookKeeperScopeProofSha256,
    long activatedAtMillis,
    long metadataVersion) { }
```

Activation lifecycle wire ids are `PREPARED=1` and `ACTIVE=2`；record identity fields and enabled bits are validated
independently of enum ordinal.

Publication bits advance monotonically only after their milestone gate. Ledger deletion additionally requires：

- complete all-256-shard root/protection/lease scan；
- complete registered BK stream/profile/reference-domain scan；
- exact provider-scope create/write/read/fence/delete/response-loss canary；
- exact exclusive advanced-ledger-id namespace reservation digest and no stock/foreign exact-create permission in
  that prefix；
- zero `lateCreateHazard` and no retained allocation slot for every candidate selected for physical deletion；
- current stable broker readiness/config digest；
- one CAS installing all three exact proof digests and deletion bit；
- local `gcEnabled && !gcDryRun` plus exact active proof revalidation on every mutation。

Configuration alone is never deletion authority. Safe defaults start no mutating ledger collector. Namespace proof
is an operational trust boundary backed by cluster provisioning/readiness；the canary demonstrates the configured
scope but cannot manufacture exclusivity. If the reservation cannot be asserted, no BookKeeper profile may be
first-created and an already loaded topic must fail ownership/write/delete closed.

Likewise, an unknown create outcome is not repaired by an admin Boolean. Its fixed slot/hazard may exhaust new ledger
allocation by design；BK-M0–M6 require fail-closed operational escalation or a new provider-scope/prefix deployment,
and define no online hazard-clear operation.

The implemented wire value is deterministic `NBKA1` and keeps Oxia `metadataVersion` outside the stored bytes. Two
different identities are intentionally derived from it：

- exact `activationRecordSha256 = SHA-256("NBKA1" || u32be(keyUtf8Length) || keyUtf8 ||
  i64be(metadataVersion) || storedValueSha256Bytes)` binds every deletion candidate/proof；any activation CAS changes
  it and invalidates in-flight destructive work；
- stable `publicationActivationSha256 = SHA-256` over the `NBKAP1` domain、canonical key、protocol/schema、cluster、
  provider/config/namespace and the ACTIVE all-three-publication facts. It excludes broker readiness、deletion bit/
  proofs、timestamps、Oxia version and stored-value digest，and is the only activation identity advertised in broker
  lookup properties.

This split prevents deletion activation or readiness rollover from changing the property that is itself an input to
broker readiness；`NBKA1` remains the destructive-operation identity and `NBKAP1` remains the first-create publication
identity. They are not interchangeable.

`PREPARED=1` and `ACTIVE=2` are explicit wire ids；PREPARED has zero publication bits/proofs，ACTIVE must at least
publish WAL_ONLY，async requires WAL_ONLY，sync requires async，and deletion requires sync plus three individually
nonzero proof digests. Readiness epoch cannot decrease or change digest at the same epoch；publication/deletion bits
cannot clear；deletion proofs become immutable once enabled。

`BookKeeperProtocolActivationCoordinator` and `BookKeeperPrimaryWalAdministration.prepareActivation/activate` now
provide the explicit CAS control plane. Broker bootstrap performs an exact read only：it installs writer/reader support
even when activation is absent or PREPARED so historical topics remain readable，but publishes no BK lookup capability
until the same durable record is ACTIVE with WAL_ONLY、async and sync publication enabled. The broker property set
includes the stable `NBKAP1` digest，so any old/missing/drifted publication binding fails the same stable two-snapshot
first-create barrier. Enabling publication after broker bootstrap requires the normal broker rollout/restart so every
broker advertises the newly verified stable binding；the runtime never hot-patches lookup identity from an admin CAS。

Physical deletion has a separate live barrier. `BookKeeperBrokerReadinessProvider` obtains two stable snapshots of the
strongest `BOOKKEEPER_WAL_SYNC_OBJECT` property set under the
`nereus-bookkeeper-primary-wal-broker-readiness-v1` digest domain. `DefaultBookKeeperProtocolActivationVerifier`
reloads the exact NBKA1 record，derives its deletion proof，then requires the live epoch/SHA to equal the record and
checks broker-count-plus-one against reader-lease capacity. Registry events、broker restart/set drift or property drift
clear the cache and fail closed. Thus an admin caller cannot authorize deletion by storing an arbitrary readiness
epoch/digest even if every other activation field is syntactically valid。

Checkpoint E installs a production `BookKeeperLedgerRetentionService` only for explicit
`gcEnabled && !gcDryRun`。It scans every root shard、retires exact owner-authorized protections and drives the existing
mark/drain/delete/dual-absence manager one step per pass。This does not make local configuration deletion authority：
the current activation record、namespace and live strongest-profile broker readiness are reloaded/revalidated by the
gate and again before each provider-facing mutation。
Until the three proof producers below install `ledgerDeletionEnabled=true`，the service can make safe logical reference
progress but physical ledger deletion remains fail closed。

## 7. First-create and reopen admission

### 7.1 First create

```text
resolve requested/default profile
storage-class creation guard proves no stock BK/Nereus durable conflict
require exact profile capability/readiness + activation publication bit
create durable Nereus stream metadata with immutable profile
store BK configuration + ledger-id namespace binding for BK profiles
create F2 topic/virtual-ledger projection
register generation/materialization stream if object-enabled
finish storage-class binding ACTIVE
open/recover writer
return topic
```

If any prerequisite fails before stream metadata/profile publication, no BK IO occurs. If durable create steps are
partially applied, existing binding/creation recovery converges the exact profile; it never re-reads a changed broker
default and chooses another profile.

### 7.2 Existing topic

```text
load durable binding + stream metadata + projection
ignore current default profile
require local adapter/config matches stored profile/binding
require current cluster readiness for ownership/writes
recover writer/ledger state before writable publication
install F3 cursor + F4 services as profile requires
```

Loaded and unloaded admin paths use durable binding/profile facts. An unloaded topic is not interpreted from namespace
default policy.

### 7.3 Profile mutation

Any attempt to change `StreamMetadataRecord.profile` or its BK configuration binding after first create is rejected.
Updating `nereusDefaultStorageProfile` affects new streams only. There is no “close and reopen to migrate” behavior.

## 8. Broker ownership lifecycle

### 8.1 Normal load

After topic ownership is acquired, Nereus obtains/renews the Oxia append session, reconciles writer state, and only
publishes `NereusManagedLedger` writable after any prior ACTIVE ledger is resolved. Read-only historical open can start
earlier only through non-recovery BK reads and must not recovery-open/fence.

### 8.2 Unload/close

```text
stop new facade appends
drain bounded in-flight attempts
seal current ledger when time permits; otherwise leave durable SEALING/RECOVERING state
release/expire append session
close Nereus-owned ledger handles/read cache
do not close borrowed BK client
complete unload within broker budget
```

An unload timeout is recoverable durable state, not permission to discard ledger roots/reservations.

### 8.3 Failover/restart

New owner follows document 04 fencing sequence, allocates a new ledger and preserves logical offsets. Two brokers may
contend on recovery, but only the writer-state/session/root CAS winner becomes writable. Workers may run on either
broker against shared F4 tasks; source protections and claims serialize physical work independently of topic owner.

## 9. Stock BookKeeper isolation

Stock Pulsar topics and Nereus BK-profile topics may share the same client/BookKeeper cluster, but not metadata
authority：

- Nereus uses only its reserved positive-63-bit advanced-id prefix；stock clients use normal allocation and must not
  call exact `CreateAdv` inside that prefix；
- stock ManagedLedger metadata/ledgers are never inserted into Nereus root keyspace；
- Nereus ledgers carry exact `NBKL1` custom metadata and global Oxia root/allocation identity；
- Nereus reader/deleter requires both root and matching custom metadata；
- a ledger-id collision with stock/foreign metadata is never deleted；a new random candidate inside the reserved
  prefix is chosen and the collision invalidates deletion activation for audit；
- Nereus does not invoke stock ManagedLedger trim/delete APIs for its physical ledgers；
- stock control topic write/read/retention remains in every real two-broker gate。

## 10. Profile rollout

Recommended operational rollout mirrors implementation milestones：

```text
1. reserve/provision the exact ledger-id namespace, then deploy BK-capable readers/codecs/module with all
   publication/delete bits off
2. establish stable cluster readiness/config/namespace digests
3. enable BK_ONLY publication for canary first-create topics
4. pass restart/unload/failover/rollover/logical-trim gates
5. enable BK_ASYNC publication; keep ledger delete dry-run initially
6. verify lag/object publication/source-retirement; activate scoped ledger deletion
7. enable BK_SYNC publication and completion SLOs
8. expand profile policy only after BK-M6 aggregate gate
```

Removing capability from one broker prevents new BK topic creates and ownership/writes there. Rollback must keep at
least read/recovery support for already-created BK targets; downgrading to a build that cannot decode/read durable BK
targets is prohibited.

## 11. No online migration in BK-M0–M6

These operations are rejected：

```text
OBJECT_WAL_* -> BOOKKEEPER_WAL_*
BOOKKEEPER_WAL_* -> OBJECT_WAL_*
BK_ONLY -> BK_ASYNC_OBJECT
BK_ASYNC_OBJECT -> BK_SYNC_OBJECT
```

A future migration delivery needs a durable state machine：

```text
fence append session
freeze barrier offset/profile generations
drain/reconcile old writer/tasks
publish target-profile capability/checkpoint
new commits after barrier use new primary target
old commits retain original reader/protection/retention rules
complete/backfill under explicit migration policy
```

Migration never rewrites a committed target or makes policy mutation reinterpret old physical identity. The future
design must separately decide whether BK_ONLY -> async backfills pre-barrier history.

## 12. Compatibility matrix

| Dimension | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Object-WAL + BK-WAL topics | same brokers/runtime; correct registry dispatch; no target casts |
| stock BookKeeper topic | unchanged write/read/trim while Nereus BK profiles operate/delete own ledgers |
| old Object target chain | remains decodable/readable after BK module rollout |
| BK generation zero + Object higher generation | highest healthy selection/fallback/source retirement exact |
| ordinary/batched Pulsar entries | raw Entry bytes/properties and virtual MessageIds unchanged |
| cursor seek/history/restart | F3 logical positions independent of physical ledger rollover/deletion |
| topic unload/failover/rejoin | new ledger per session, no offset gap/duplicate head |
| partitioned topics | each partition has its own immutable profile/stream/ledger lifecycle |
| loaded/unloaded admin | durable profile/readiness route; no default-profile reinterpretation |
| config mismatch/old broker | pre-IO rejection and ownership exclusion |

## 13. Operations and observability

Admin/status surfaces may expose：profile、configuration digest、active segment sequence/ledger id (operator-only)、
writer/root lifecycle、materialization lag、sealed/reclaimable ledger counts、blocked veto reason and sync completion
latency. They are read-only projections of durable/provider facts.

Sensitive fields are redacted. Logs use stable hashes for stream/fencing/config identities and never entry payload or
password. Alerts distinguish：allocation/recovery stuck、checksum/auth mismatch、materialization lag、retention veto、
DELETING dual-absence retry and capability/readiness drift.

## 14. BK-M5 acceptance

BK-M5 is not the first integration test; BK-M2–M4 already require focused local-Pulsar entry tests. M5 closes rollout
only after：

- all configuration/reserved-property/readiness/activation tests pass；
- first-create stores immutable exact profile and unsupported routes are pre-IO；
- loaded/unloaded/partitioned routing is deterministic；
- two brokers prove ownership transfer, unload, crash/restart/rejoin and reverse takeover；
- ordinary/compressed-batch exact MessageIds and cursor seek/history remain stable；
- stock BookKeeper control topic coexists throughout；
- borrowed client closes exactly once by its stock owner；
- safe defaults schedule no BookKeeper delete；
- an explicitly activated canary scope proves response-loss-safe deletion without touching foreign/stock ledgers。
